This study aims to propose a framework for safety in domestic walking tourism, which defines the scope and type of safety information for tourists. Also, the framework provides a systematic classification for safety information in walking tourism. As the importance of safety in walking tourism due to the frequent occurrence of crimes and unexpected accidents increases, it is necessary to provide tourists with safety information on walking courses rapidly and systematically. However, most administrators (e.g., local governments) have mainly focused on providing tour information on walking courses through Internet websites or mobile apps, overlooking the safety issue. Besides, there is a lack of understanding of safety not only in walking tourism but also in the whole tourism industry.
Design/methodology/approach
This study proposes the framework that covers all possible safety-related information in walking tourism. Furthermore, to validate its availability, this study analyzes eight major platforms which offer tour information to tourists by applying the framework.
Findings
The major findings of this study are as follows. First, all platforms considered in this study do not provide any information on tourism safety, focusing on the provision of tour information. Second, three platforms currently provide an SOS function which means post-safety information. That is, no safety information is provided to prevent safety issues in advance. Finally, despite the increase of social concerns, all platforms do not provide safety information on public order and diseases in the social disaster classification as well as environmental pollution in the natural disaster classification. The details and implications of the findings are presented.",

However, the process of building a dominant trade show brand, what constitutes a trade show brand, has not been well understood. This study examines a critical role of self-brand connection(SBC) based on customer-based brand equity(CBBE), investigating the influences of brand credibility and image on SBC. Additionally, SBC is positioned as a mediator of brand credibility and image on brand equity. Building on extensive literature, a model of the relationship is developed and empirically tested using survey data collected from 235 respondents from the KIMES (Korea International Medical & Hospital Equipment Show). Findings suggest that SBC is offered as an outcome of brand credibility and image as well as a mediator of the influence on brand equity. Based on these results, this study suggests the theoretical and practical implications regarding successful trade show branding.",

Frequency analysis was used for analysing demographic traits and patterns of smartphone using. Cross tabulation analysis was used for analysing relations between variables. Regression analysis was used for the analysing the influences of the characteristics of tourism information on the tourist satisfaction and revisiting. The results say that smartphone users use different APP and sites for searching general tourism information and choosing tourist destination. It turns out that satisfaction degrees with smartphone users for tourism information search were “medium” and suggest that more efforts are needed to increase the satisfaction degree. It is verified that among the characteristics of tourism information, accuracy, usefulness, connectivity, and sufficiency have impact on the satisfaction degree and that accuracy, usefulness, connectivity influence the revisiting.

The study data were collected from semi-constructed interviews with twenty participants. Documents were collected as a secondary data source and reviewed to confirm consistency in findings. This study revealed features of core actors and networks as well as actor management along processes in TP and smart tourism policy making (STP). TP and STP networks in Korea were characterized by the institutional structure of administrative agencies, their dominance, high degree of centrality and lack of balance in information exchanges between public and private sectors. STP networks, in particular, were characterized by prominent corporations from ICT industry and an unclear focal unit, which resulted in lack of clarity in actors` roles and ownership of smart tourism policy. Along the STP process, administrative agencies did not develop a pre-defined framework for policy formulation and interconnect multiple policy networks. This study discussed the meaningful recommendations for both practitioners and researchers.",

In particular, this paper recognizes the substantial impact of information communication technology(ICT) has had on extending our mobility as a tourist. Further, this technology han resulted in a new concept whereby `people as sensors` is seen as a central tool for collecting information and documenting the tourist experience. This paper proposed a new framework based on this extended notion of tourist mobility and argues that it is useful for destination management organizations to develop smart destinations which focus on the tourist experiences.",
