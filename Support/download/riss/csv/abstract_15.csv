Geotagging which is one of the newest technologies in the smart tourism field, is reckoned as being very useful for travelers in enhancing the experience with visiting places. However the remarkable difference exists in attitudes toward adoption of new technologies among travelers. Although this has triggered a series of studies dedicated to traveler``s readiness that is supposed to have significant influence on new technology adoption, there is still a gap in the understanding of the tourist``s attitude towards the adoption of new technologies. Considering that, this study, focusing on the perspective of traveler``s readiness and technology acceptance model with hedonic view, aims at analyzing the relationships between traveler’s readiness, geotag technology perception and geotag adoption, and finding the key factors influencing the technology adoption. The study investigates traveler’s readiness as a second-order formative factor comprising of role clarity and ability and concentrates on three factors of general technology perceptions as geotag usefulness, geotag ease of use, and geotag enjoyment. Data were gathered by conducting survey between 10-12th of December 2014 to actual geotag users. Partial Least Square techniques were used for hypotheses testing. The following results were obtained in Figure 1. Negative and insignificant relationship between traveler’s readiness and geotag usefulness were found. Also, positive relationships between traveler’s readiness and geotag ease of use and enjoyment were found. The influence of geotag ease of use on geotag usefulness was also found. Besides, the results show that both geotag ease of use and geotag enjoyment significantly influence the continuance use of technology, emphasizing that enjoyment is the most significant antecedent of geotag adoption. But, geotag usefulness didn’t significantly affect the geotag continuance use. This study hopes to contribute in theoretical and practical ways providing more information about how traveler’s readiness and technology perception factors influence geotag continuance use.",

This project aims to investigate the effects of sport events as public diplomacy by adopting and extending the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen 1991). This paper presents preliminary findings on the effects of hosting an international sport event on foreign audiences` perception and beliefs toward the relationship with the host country. The 2015 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup hosted by Australia was used as a case study for this project, and South Korea was chosen as a community to investigate the effects of sport events as public diplomacy. The data were collected from the general public of South Korea through a questionnaire survey administered via Smart Phone application which is designed for market research, a week after the AFC Asian Cup final. A total of 500 valid questionnaires were collected. An independent t-test was performed to examine the differences on the perception and beliefs toward Korea engaging with Australia between Koreans who watched the event and those who did not watch. It was found that people who watched the event have a more favourable attitude toward the relationship between Korea and Australia, believe there is a higher social expectation and confidence for Korea to engage with Australia, and have a higher intention to support Korean businesses that invest in Australia and encourage the Korean government engaging with Australia. The results suggest that hosting an international sport event can facilitate more favourable international relations through positively affecting foreign audiences` perception and beliefs toward their country engaging with the host country.",

Specifically, it can totally reconfigure its strategic canvas to create new markets or blue oceans in convention service which are not existing yet.
  By applying to our study ‘the value innovation principle’ of providing new values with lower costs, we suggest that the Busan’s convention hub should eliminate or reduce small size events and instead raise up big, super-size, events with convention capacity expansion. It also needs to provide totally creative concepts of services in which ‘Fun and Smart’ elements are well concocted into traditional convention services. To explain this strategic distinction, we further discuss on how BEXCO can reshuffle itself as opposed to other rival convention places.","Abstract
