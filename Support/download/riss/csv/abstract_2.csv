The spatial movement patterns of tourists` walking behavior are classified as 3 types: straight pattern, circuit pattern and complex pattern. Tourism planners and policy makers of community-based tourism should focus on these limited patterns of spatial usage by these walking tourists to adopt policies with such measures in mind.

The following are the findings of this study as a result of a substantial survey:
  First, the polarity of tourism information for Smart-phone has a significant impact on the perception of physical distance. Second, interactivity has a significant negative impact on the perception of physical distance and cultural distance. Third, usability has a significant impact on the overall perception of distance, including physical distance, cultural distance, and psychological distance. Finally, the reliability of tourism information for Smart-phone does not have a significant impact on the perception of distance.
  Overall, the individual characteristics of tourism information for Smart-phone had a positive impact on the tourist""s perception to the tourist attraction.
