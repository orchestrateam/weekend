An integral type one-piece door impact beam of bracket parts and pipe was realized using hot stamping technology. The method involves the heating in the austenite region and subsequent hot forming and quenching in a specially designed stamping tool with hydraulic system. A one-piece door impact beam is 6.8% lighter than a three-piece door impact beam because it eliminates two bracket parts. The one-piece door impact beam was hot-stamped with dies without cooling channels inside the dies, and revealed a Vickers hardness higher than 430 and a fully martensitic microstructure. Two one-piece door impact beams, with a straight pipe with circular cross section and a straight pipe with partially circular and partially elliptical cross section in the middle part of the pipe, were used for the collision analysis. The door impact beam with partially circular and partially elliptical cross section showed less plastic strain in the middle part of the pipe compared with the circular pipe, leading to better intrusion property. Intrusion analysis results also showed that the three-pieces door impact beam fractured at a 336 mm displacement due to excessive plastic strain in the welded part between the bracket and pipe. In contrast, the integral type one-piece door impact beam without welding did not show any fracture, even at a 457.2 mm displacement, confirming the better performance against lateral collision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,자동차 조립 라인의 병목공정을 고려한 실시간 적정 차량 투입순서 결정에 관한 연구 = A Study on the Determination of Real Time Proper Vehicle Input Order Considering the Bottleneck Process of Automobile Assembly Line,"Bottleneck analysis,Dispatching algorithm,Mixed production,Simulation verification","Increasing the productivity of flow shops where mixed products are produced is difficult to be achieved by utilizing a fixed production schedule. In automobile production lines, especially in the process of painting, it is economical to input a batch of vehicles in the same color into the process after another one. However, in the process of assembly, such input sequence may cause imbalance in the line due to many problems. In practice, there are buffers placed between the painting process and the assembly process to mitigate such problem. Thus, the productivity can be improved by changing the input sequence of the products from the buffers to the assembly process. However, most of the rules for input sequence are generated on the basis of the experience of the product managers, it is difficult to derive input schedules that can be applied to the production of a new model or a new factory. Therefore, in this study, we developed an input algorithm that is able to find the bottleneck process and mitigate it in real time for the assembly line. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing the productivity with the existing input rules through the simulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to find the coefficient of friction between two materials. This paper focuses on obtaining the coefficient of friction between an aiming bolt and a retainer located in the headlamps of a vehicle. This bolt supports the headlamp, and if the bolt is loosened by external vibration, the angle of the light will change and block the vision of pedestrians or other drivers. In order to study these situations, the coefficient of friction between aiming bolts and retainers needs to be measured. In addition, the coefficient of friction of materials used in the headlamp should be obtained. To determine these two factors, a new device is designed for two cases: surface-surface contact and surface-line contact. To increase reliability of the results, the device is designed using an air-bearing stage which uses compressed air as lubricant to eliminate the friction of the stage itself. Experiments were carried out by applying various vertical forces, and the results show that the coefficient of friction can be measured consistently.

In this study, structural analysis is performed on silicone rubber- type waterproof seals used in the voltage connector. For the structural analysis, the tensile properties of the actual rubber seal are evaluated using a miniaturized tensile testing machine. The Mooney-Rivlin material constants of the rubber seal are determined as follows; D1=0, C01=0.241, C10=0.0142. The analysis shows that the contact pressure at the top of the seal where the seal and male connector are in contact is approximately three times higher than that at the bottom of the seal where the seal and female connector are in contact. It is confirmed that the waterproofing performance of the rubber seal depends on the contact pressure of the seal bottom where the seal and female connector are in contact. The contact pressure for waterproofing is found to be 4.7 bar. The strain concentration of the curved part is attributed to excessive initial tension. Therefore, a redesign is recommended for uniform stress or strain distribution in the curved section of the seal in response to the stress relaxation problem due to permanent deformation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study focuses on the self-loosening of the aiming bolt of the head lamp in a vehicle. It is important to prevent the aiming bolt from self-loosening as it has a decisive effect on the angle of the head lamp. A nut clamped with a bolt, known as a retainer, is made of plastic and has a partial screw thread. In addition, a transverse load has a considerable impact on the self-loosening of a bolt. We concentrate on the self-loosening of a bolt by a transverse load. The aim of this study is to define the limits of the external force that loosen the bolt.
Based on the above conditions, we derive a theoretical equation and develop a numerical analysis program that can calculate the limiting forces for self-loosening. To verify the developed program, we design a test device that can measure the self-loosening by applying sliding forces to the aiming bolt. Using this method, we can draw the following conclusions. First, the developed testing device is suitable to prove the theory for calculating the self-loosening force. Second, the equation confirms the relationship of bolt self-loosening between resistance torque and shear force. Finally, the equation obtains the minimum value of the resistance torque required to decrease the change in the angle of the head lamp, thereby improving the possibility of increasing the stability of the head lamp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior studies have mainly concentrated on relatively large-sized SFDs used in aircraft engines, turbocompressors, and turbopumps. The main objective of the current study is to propose a test rig for identification of dynamic force coefficients of small-sized SFDs (a journal diameter of ~11 mm). The current test rig consists of a journal, a SFD cartridge, four support rods, an upper structure, a data acquisition (DAQ) system, and an oil circulation unit. The annular gaps between the journal outer surface and SFD cartridge inner surface create SFD film lands. The damper has two parallel film lands separated by a central groove, having an axial length and depth of 3 mm. Each film land has a length of 4 mm with a 40 μm radial clearance. The static load and dynamic impact tests identify the structural characteristics (i.e., stiffness and natural frequency) of the journal and assembled test rig.

Pressing and stamping are important processes in automotive production and result in additional straining on the vehicle body and chassis sheet material. It is therefore important to have knowledge of the effect of pre-straining on the reliability and mechanical behavior of sheets such as tensile and fatigue strength. This work sought to evaluate the mechanical properties of hot-rolled steel sheets prepared with different levels of pre-straining, which can cause a change in the final thickness of the sheets. Hot-rolled steel sheets, SAPH440 and SPHC with a nominal initial thickness value of 2.4 mm were used to obtain pre-strained sheets with pre-straining levels of 5~20%. Final thickness with pre-strain was measured to verify the correlation between thickness reduction ratio and mechanical properties. Macro and microscopic analysis results showed there was a uniform relationship between the reduction ratio and pre-strain despite the increasing sheet straining levels.
The mechanical test results showed that by increasing the pre-straining level up to uniform elongation, the tensile and fatigue strength also increased, because of the work hardening effects with deformation. When pre-straining exceeded the uniform elongation, the mechanical properties decreased drastically when the thickness was modified by the initial value before pre-straining. Based upon the relation between mechanical behaviors and pre-straining, one can precisely predict design reliability and material durability by measuring the thickness change of the sheet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  Background: There are a variety of design variables related to tactile affection of vehicle interior materials. Previous studies about sensibility engineering for vehicle interior material mainly interested to visual sense, and some studies for tactile sense had limitations performed in actual vehicle conditions where human sensibility could be affected by several noise factors. Therefore, it is necessary to make material’s samples considering various levels of design variables related to the material properties, and to determine the optimal design combinations to improve tactile affection.
  Method: A total of 72 subjects, 59 males and 13 females, participated in this experiment. A total of 18 TPO materials were fabricated to evaluate the affective satisfaction, according to the physical property levels of the interior materials. Affective satisfaction with a sense of touch was used as a dependent variable, and roughness, hardness and coefficient of friction were considered as three independent variables. For 18 samples provided by combinations of three independent variables, the affective satisfaction was measured repeatedly according to the within-subject design. ANOVA and regression analysis were carried out to derive optimal design values for vehicle interior materials.
  Results: The optimal regression model was derived from the best subset regression analysis, which included hardness and roughness variables. In addition, the optimal design values were predicted through the iso-response contour plots obtained by the response surface model. The optimum tactile affection condition can be provided from the middle level of hardness and the low level of roughness.
  Conclusion: By suggesting the optimal material property level of TPO material, it is possible to provide improved affective satisfaction that can be felt in high quality interior materials.

First, it was noticed that the result of comparing the acoustic components measured by both microphones has the same tendency as the simulation. Second, it was confirmed that the algorithm is effective by comparing the components of the acoustic component according to the presence or absence of flow. However, it was observed that the limited number of sensors and the spacing among them would lead to aliasing and resolution problems. It is advised that in order to acquire an improved result in separating the acoustic component, the interval of sensors be minimized and the number be adjusted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Background: The two-consecutive-daytime shift replaces day-night shift system in order to reduce night-time working hours and improve the workers' health conditions.
The effect of changing shift system is not clearly established yet although there are studies investigating short-term effects. Thus investigating the long-term effects of two-consecutive-daytime shift system can provide the insights on the effectiveness of the new shift system and its influence on the workers' welfare.
Method: Questionnaire surveys were conducted in a car-part assembly factory in 2015, 2016 and 2019. In the year of 2015, 2016, the shift system was day-night shift whereas two-consecutive day shift system was already in place in the year of 2019.
Total number of 137 (year of 2015), 142 (year of 2016), and 126 (year of 2019) workers participated in the survey on the working environment including working hours, labor intensity and the workers' health conditions, such as, musculoskeletal symptoms, sleep disorders, digestive disorders. The differences before and after the change of shift system are compared by a series of statistical task along with some qualitative analysis on free-form comments.
Results: The two-consecutive daytime shift system brought positive results of shorter working hours, increased spare time, rest time and day off. The workers satisfied with their work as well as working hours (p <0.001). Compared to the previous shift system, the health index (PSQI) nighttime decreased from 10.5 to 9.3 (p <0.001), and the daytime sleepiness also decreased from 12.3 to 9.1 (p <0.001). Similarly, the insomnia score decreased statistically significantly from 12.3 to 9.0 (p <0.001) in the new twoconsecutive- daytime shift system. In addition, digestive symptoms and musculoskeletal symptoms decreased statistically significantly on the criteria of NIOSH. Change of the shift system influenced on the working conditions, which were focused on the efficiency of the production. The improvement of equipment relieved the workload of lifting, which showed that the physical loads on the waist (p =0.0189) and shoulders (p =0.063) were significantly decreased. On the other hand, the improvement of working conditions increased the efficiency of the production system, and resulted in an increased workload level. Although the ergonomic assessment reduced the inappropriate posture of the waist and shoulders to the point of statistical difference, the overall level of action was not changed as for the statistical difference. The subjective fatigue increased and the movement of the hand and arm also increased.
Conclusion: The introduction of consecutive daytime two shift shows positive results in worker health indicators, work and leisure life. However, there was an evidence of intensified work intensity in the process of increasing the efficiency of production in the shorter working hours than the previous shifts system.
Application: The findings of this study provides a basis for applying two-consecutivedaytime shift system on a factory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the current trends in powertrain system improvement, the operating conditions of powertrain components such as gears are becoming more severe. As a result, it is increasingly important to improve the strength and durability of the materials used for the powertrain system by optimizing alloy design and heat treatment. Much research and development has focused on improving components by heat treatment, and especially carburization. Also, many different alloy concepts, such as Fe-Cr-Mo or Fe-Cr-Ni systems have been proposed for automotive components. Among various approaches, Cr and Si , and solid solution hardening, are known to effectively increase hardenability. However, it has been reported in many works that the carburized case depth can also be reduced by increasing the Cr/Si content, due to oxide film formation. The mechanism of Cr/Si oxide film formation during carburization has not yet been clearly determined. In the present work, therefore, the mechanism of surface oxide film formation during carburization was examined.

2019,자동차 조립작업의 작업부하 및 연령에 따른 작업능력 차이 조사,"Work ability,Work load,Automobile assembly worker,Aging","Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the work ability and work load of automobile assembly workers according to age.

Background: Previous studies indicated that self-reported musculoskeletal symptoms for assembly line workers corresponded to 38% and 14% relative to the shoulder and lower arm. As age increases, physical and mental abilities begin to decline. Reduced physical and mental abilities affect work capacity and workload. Decrease in work capacity due to aging affects production and quality as well as safety and health. Workers working on automobile assembly lines have high physical and mental demands. Therefore, efforts should be made to evaluate and manage the work ability and workload of the worker.

Method: This study was conducted on 107 workers working in the automobile assembly line. In this study, we used the Work Ability Index (WAI) developed by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH) in Finland to assess the work capacity of workers. The QEC (Quick Exposure Check) tool developed in the UK was used to analyze workload differences among workers.

Results: Workers in automobile assembly line has a high work load in all tasks due to repetitive work and awkward working postures. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean work ability score according to age, but the individual difference (deviation) was found to be large with increasing age. There was no statistically significant difference in the exposure ratio according to age, but the individual difference (deviation) with respect to the work load was found to be larger with age. In addition, the higher the age, the more the number of subjective workloads for immediate improvement.

Conclusion: Aging can affect production and quality as well as safety and health. Physiological changes due to age increase are very natural phenomena and can not be blocked by change, but the decrease width and timing can be controlled by effort. In order to do this, it is necessary to accurately grasp and measure work items that can be unreasonable to workers through job analysis. Efforts should be made to develop and apply engineering and management improvement measures by evaluating the identified work items according to ergonomic evaluation criteria and deriving improvement items.

Application: The results of this study are expected to be used as basic data for worker management of automobile assembly lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These steels are prepared using a vacuum induction melting furnace to produce binary and ternary alloys. The hardness and tensile strength of the high manganese steel decrease and the elongation increases with increase in manganese content. This material exhibits high values of hardness, tensile strength, and elongation; these properties are similar to those of 7-3 brass used in conventional friction materials. We fabricate high manganese steel fibers to prepare test pad specimens, and evaluate the friction and wear characteristics by simulating various braking conditions using a 1/5 scale dynamometer. The brake pad material is found to have excellent friction stability in comparison with conventional friction materials that use 7-3 brass fibers; particularly, the friction stability at high temperature is significantly improved. Additionally, we evaluate the wear using a wear test method that simulates the braking conditions in Europe. It is found that the amount of wear of the brake pad is the same as that in the case of the conventional friction material, and that the amount of wear of the cast iron disc is reduced by approximately 10.

The vibration-damping plate is largely divided into a constrained type in which the resin is confined by a plate and a non-constrained type in which a plate is made of a polymer material mainly composed of polymer. The external vibration energy is absorbed by the thermal energy required for friction, stretching and compression of resin, so that the noise and vibration generated by resonance are reduced. The vibration damping ability of the sandwich plate produced in this study was found to be somewhat superior, which may be due to the difference in adhesive force during the manufacture of the sandwich plate. In the experimental results, it was confirmed that the sandwich plate material is superior to the vibration damping ability than the 5182 aluminum single plate material, it can be seen that the sandwich plate is effective for vibration damping of the aluminum alloy plate material.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: In order to carry out the research, a total of 10 spaces were derived from each company""s self - driving car case study, and it was defined as 5 steps according to autonomous driving stage 3 and 5 stages based on autonomous driving stage The survey results were classified according to gender, marriage, driver""s gender, age, marriage status, family members, and purpose of car use, and conducted a recursive 5-point scale (one point very dissatisfactory/two points dissatisfaction/3 points average/4 points satisfaction/5 points) In the final conclusion, based on the preference of each type of space derived from the questionnaire, the representative subjects of the questionnaire were selected and interviewed, and the research was completed with qualitative survey.

Results: ""Back seat (forward / backward)"" was the most favorable choice for drivers.

Conclusion: In the Level 3 of autonomous driving, we preferred the space configuration that is conveniently used in lines that do not deteriorate safety. In addition, users"" expectations for autonomous vehicles have not been favored, and the composition of monotonous spaces such as internal combustion engine cars is not preferred. In the Level 5 of autonomous driving, it was free from the responsibility of driving, so it needed a space to meet various purposes.

Nevertheless, its application to auto parts has been severely restricted, mainly due to a substantial reduction in the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) induced by aqueous corrosion. The susceptibility to this HE is closely associated with the carbon content, which leads essentially to the precipitation of iron carbides (Fe2.4C / Fe3C) with a low hydrogen overvoltage. This study focuses mainly on the effect of carbon content on the aqueous corrosion and hydrogen diffusion characteristics of ultra-strong steels. The hydrogen reduction reaction on the steel surface, and its diffusion kinetics in the steel matrix were evaluated using electrochemical polarization and hydrogen permeation tests, respectively. Furthermore, the HE indices of steels with different carbon contents were determined in a weakly acidic solution using the slow strain rate test (SSRT). This study demonstrates clearly that the hydrogen reduction rates were increased and its diffusion kinetics were decreased significantly, with increasing carbon content.

During this process, a certain depth of products is rapidly heated and quenched so that the microstructure of the hardened surface is finer than those of the other parts of the product. In general, the hardening depth is more uniform in the straight surface than in the irregular- or complex-shaped surfaces because of the non-uniform heating and cooling rates in the irregular surfaces applied from the induction coils. This non-uniform hardening depth can cause unexpected deterioration of the fatigue properties. In this study, high-frequency induction hardening was applied to an SM53C steel automotive part having a 90° curved shape, and the microstructure and hardness variation in the curvature area were characterized in detail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use the GLS statistical technique, panel and survey data of 130 secondary auto-part suppliers in the Daegu and Kyungpook area in 2007-2016. The evidence shows that the secondary auto-part suppliers struggle to prepare documents for the FTA certificates of origin due to their small firm size, although they utilize the FTA at the relatively high rate of 92 percent. Statistical evidence shows that an increase in the export of the first vender significantly affects the sale of the secondary auto-part vendors, but not their profit. The low profit and high managing cost of utilizing the FTA deteriorate the utilization effect of the FTA of the secondary auto-part vendors, which is a key factor in a global supply chain and for the competitiveness of the automobile industry. Government policies are required for the secondary auto-part suppliers to utilize the FTA more effectively and share the benefits of tariff reduction with first auto-part vendors under FTA transaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, cyclic operation in the permeation test is also conducted to clarify the corrosion-induced hydrogen evolution behavior. In contrast to the conventional perception that the cathodic reduction reaction on the steel in neutral aqueous environments is an oxygen reduction reaction, this study demonstrates that atomic hydrogen may be generated on the steel surface by the corrosion reaction, even in a neutral environment. Although a much lower permeation current density and significant slower diffusion kinetics of hydrogen are observed compared to the results measured in acidic environments, they contribute to the increase in the embrittlement index.

The E-CCT accelerates both the coating degradation and the perforation corrosion. The applied potential for the coating degradation was determined to be -500 mVSCE for anodic polarization and -900 mVSCE for cathodic polarization. The applied current for the perforation corrosion was equivalent to the applied anodic potential. The E-CCT was conducted for the duration of 8 cycles, which is considered to be equivalent to 4 years of driving. After the E-CCT, the coating degradation was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements.
Especially, the Z100 mHz value (impedance value at a frequency of 100 mHz) of the part unit represented the amount of corrosion damage of the lower arm parts. The Z100 mHz of the degraded coating area had a decisive effect on the Z100 mHz value of the entire lower arm. This result was caused by electrochemical interaction between the non-degraded coating area and degraded coating area. The non-degraded coating area and the degraded coating area of the lower arm formed the parallel circuit which provides a satisfactory result.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, previous studies are limited in terms of explaining marketing efficiency from the perspective of automobile characteristics. Thus, this study measures the marketing efficiency of 22 global automobile brands using metafrontier analysis. Through metafrontier analysis, global automaker brands can be classified into two groups (luxury and mainstream) according to consumer brand perception attributes or into three groups (Asia, Euro, USA) according to automobile geographic production regions. The analysis results provide general insights into the marketing capabilities of global automotive brands and the contemporaneous efficiency of individual automaker brands.
The implications of this study are as follows: First, the average metaefficiency of mainstream automobile brands is greater than luxury brands. This result demonstrates that luxury car brands need strategic alternatives to maximize their marketing performance. Second, the major factor of inefficiency in most global automobile brands is purely technical under the CRS and VRS assumption. Therefore, these global automobile brands need a strategic approach to improve managerial performance.

The vehicle developed to solve these problems is a plug-in hybrid vehicle. It is possible to drive a certain distance by using electric motor and when the battery runs out, it operate the engine. Plug-in hybrid vehicle have a complicated structure and a lot of parts comparing a general vehicle because the electric parts and the internal combustion engine are installed together. Therefore, as the aging (mileage) of the plug-in hybrid vehicle, the influence which change of fuel consumption is expected to be larger than a general vehicle, but an experimental data are lacking.
In this paper, we cumulate a mileage of the plug-in hybrid vehicle about 15,000 km and measured the fuel economy when the cumulated distance reached within 160 km, 6,500 km, 15,000 km respectively, by using domestic public test method.

2019,Ni 및 Cu 첨가가 고온 산화된 자동차용 초고강도 강재의 부식 거동에 미치는 영향 = Effect of Ni and Cu Addition on Corrosion Behaviors of Pre-Oxidized Ultra-Strong Steel for Automotive Applications,"nickel,copper,steel,oxidation scale,corrosion","The incomplete elimination of oxide scale formed during the normalizing process can result in severe degradation of the surface and mechanical properties of ultra-strong steels. This study revealed that the formation of oxide scale was highly dependent upon the alloying elements Ni and Cu. Ni-bearing steel showed a much higher oxidation rate, resulting in much thicker scale than Cu-bearing steel. Uneven scale/steel interfaces and oxide penetration along the grain boundary of the steel were clearly observed in the Ni-bearing steel. The difference in the solid solubility limit of Ni and Cu to austenite could lead to the enrichment of Ni and precipitation of Cu at scale/steel interfaces in the two types of steels, respectively. This resulted in the different structure and properties of the oxide scales, which influenced the subsequent corrosion behavior in chloride containing conditions. Linear polarization resistance measurements showed that the addition of Ni and Cu to the steel had a beneficial influence on the corrosion resistance, by suppressing the anodic dissolution and cathodic reduction reactions of Ni and Cu-bearing steels, respectively. This study provided a proposed mechanism for the difference in corrosion behaviors between the two types of steel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,부주의한 운전수들: 『위대한 개츠비』에 나타난 자동차와 여성 = Careless Drivers: Automobile and Women in The Great Gatsby,"The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald, woman driver, American modernity, automobile, mobility","This paper re-reads The Great Gatsby to examine how the automobile as a representation of modernity creates new gender discourses about women’s driving and mobility in the 1920s. During the Jazz Age, the automobile became an important part of American popular culture and significantly changed the urban life of Americans. In this context, The Great Gatsby presents the automobile as a symbol of American modernity, especially when Myrtle’s tragic car accident functions as a central incident of the plot. By investigating different female characters’ relationships to automobiles and driving, this paper argues that gender plays a substantial role to decide the way each female character identifies her experience with a car. While male characters often identify their social status and reputation based on the car they own, female characters’ approaches to cars are represented as passive and even negative in terms of their sexual promiscuity and expensive tastes. At the same time, this paper aims to read Jordan Baker as a new, alternative type of a female driver who resists negative social prejudice against women’s driving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such a production site, quality problems such as misalignment of parts (doors, trunks, roofs, etc.) to be assembled with the vehicle body or collision between assembly robots and components are often caused. In order to solve such a problem, the quality of parts is manually inspected by using mechanical jig devices outside the automated production line. Automotive inspection technology is the most commonly used field of vision, which includes surface inspection such as mounting hole spacing and defect detection, body panel dents and bends. It is used for guiding, providing location information to the robot controller to adjust the robot's path to improve process productivity and manufacturing flexibility. The most difficult weighing and measuring technology is to calibrate the surface analysis and position and characteristics between parts by storing images of the part to be measured that enters the camera's field of view mounted on the side or top of the part. The problem of the machine vision device applied to the automobile production line is that the lighting conditions inside the factory are severely changed due to various weather changes such as morning-evening, rainy days and sunny days through the exterior window of the assembly production plant. In addition, since the material of the vehicle body parts is a steel sheet, the reflection of light is very severe, which causes a problem in that the quality of the captured image is greatly changed even with a small light change.

자율주행자동차의 안전한 상용화를 위해서는 현실적으로 우선 자율주행자동차의 주행을 위한 운전면허와 관련한 내용을 어떻게 구체화하는 것이 적절한 지가 중요한 쟁점이 된다. 이러한 자율주행자동차의 운전면허의 구체화에 있어서는 그 행위나 책임에 대한 사항은 선제적ㆍ필수적으로 검토되어야 할 부분이라 할 수 있다. 이를 기반으로 운전자 및 운전외 허용행위 그 밖의 의무나 책임관련 사항 등이 보다 구체화될 수 있기 때문이다. 이는 국제적으로도 중요한 논의사항으로 기술의 실현 및 도입에 있어서도 관건이 되는 부분이라 할 수 있다.
그런 의미에서 자율주행자동차 시대를 대비하는 도로교통법 개정은 일단 기본적 사항ㆍ사람ㆍ자율주행자동차로 나누어 각각의 사항에 대해 살펴 볼 수 있다. 또한 자율주행자동차에서의 운전의 개념은 그 자율주행자동차를 본래의 사용방법에 따라 사용하는 것이 될 것이며, 이에 파생되어 운전자 지위등과 관련한 사항이 나오게 될 것이다.
뿐만 아니라 자율주행자동차의 도로교통상의 안전성 측면에서 자율주행자동차가 도로교통법을 준수할 것임의 전제가 필요하다고 할 수 있다. 따라서 이러한 측면도 고려하여 종합적인 논의ㆍ검토를 하여 보다 본질적이고 깊이 있는 논의가 체계적으로 이어질 필요가 있으며, 이에 따라 도로교통법상의 운전관련 책임사항 및 운전외 허용행위 등에 대한 논의가 보다 구체화 될 수 있다.
결국 자율주행 기술발전의 진전에 따라 자율주행자동차의 주행ㆍ운행과 관련하여 법제의 재검토가 필요하다. 행정법규 뿐만이 아니라 형사책임등과 연관되는 다양한 법에 대해 검토가 필요한 상황에서 도로교통상의 안전성 측면에서 도로교통법의 사항은 기초법적인 중요한 자리를 차지하고 있다. 이에 따라 그 중요성을 인식하여 기술의 진전을 비교ㆍ검토하여 자율주행자동차 법제 정비를 논의ㆍ대응하여 도로교통상의 안전한 자율주행 시대를 대비할 수 있도록 하여야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  자동차보험 ‘자기차량손해’ 담보종목에서 쌍방과실 사고로 자기차량에 손해가 발생한 경우 일반적으로 피보험자는 자기 보험자에게 손해액 전부를 청구하여 보상을 받는다. 이때 보험자는 계약에서 정한 자기부담금을 공제한 보험금을 지급한다. 그리고 보험자는 상대방에게 대위권을 행사하여 상대차의 과실에 해당하는 금액을 회수하게 된다.
  그런데 최근에 잇따르고 있는 하급심 판결들에서는 보험자가 대위권을 행사할 때 피보험자가 부담하기로 했던 자기부담금에 해당하는 금액을 남겨두고 그 나머지 금액만을 청구할 수 있다고 하고 있다. 그렇다면 남겨둔 자기부담금에 해당하는 그 금액은 피보험자가 다시 손해배상청구권을 행사하여 받을 수 있다는 것이다. 이렇게 되면 결과적으로 피보험자는 자기부담금 없이 모든 손해를 보장받게 되는 것이다. 이런 판결들로 인해 일부 언론과 유투버들은 마치 보험회사가 고객의 돈을 떼먹은 것처럼 보도하여 부정적인 인식이 확산되고 있다.
  하급심의 이런 판결들은 대법원 전원 합의체 판결을 그 근거로 들고 있다. 이에 이 논문에선 대법원의 이 판결은 화재보험의 일부보험에 관한 판결로서 자동차보험 자기부담금에 적용되어서는 안 된다는 점을 밝혔다.
  그럼에도 불구하고 하급심 판결처럼 분쟁의 소지가 있다면 자동차보험 약관을 개정하여 보다 구체적인 규정을 두는 것이 좋겠기에 약관개정안을 제시하였다.
  다만, 현재 보험실무에서는 상대 차의 과실의 많고 적음을 따지지 않고 최저 자기부담금을 적용하고 있는데 이 점은 불합리하다고 생각한다. 그래서 이 부분에 대한 개선안도 함께 제시하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When applying glazed color at a repair painting site, color match was carried out based on previous experiences. However, low-gloss and flat colors are relatively new and further work is required in mixing the matting agent during color matching. Therefore, in order to propose a systematic method for low-gloss and flat colors, the specimens were prepared using five colors and five steps of the matting agent ratio. Brightness, color and glossiness were compared. It was found that gloss was reduced as the mixing ratio of the matting agent was increased, while brightness increased at 45 °. Using these results, we can propose a method of controlling the mixing ratio of clear and matting agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그러나 앞으로 자율주행자동차의 상용화가 이루어지면 보험사기 역시 더욱 복잡하고 지능화될 것으로 예상됨에 따라 보험사기에 대처하는 방향 역시 지금과는 다른 모습으로 바뀌어야 할 것이다. 우선, 보험 경영학 측면에서 보다 적극적인 홍보 및 교육이 요구된다. 매체 접촉률이 높은 동영상 위주의 홍보와 함께, 보험 계약 시의 법정 의무교육 등의 제도 도입이 요구된다. 한편으로 보험사기에 대처하기 위한 DB의 구축과 보험 사기범에 대한 운전면허의 중지나 금융 거래 및 해외 출국금지 등의 강도 높은 제재방안도 검토해야 할 것이다.
또한, 자율주행자동차 사고는 매우 복잡하고 난해한 사고가 많아지기 때문에 새로운 보험제도 도입의 필요성이 있는데, 이 새로운 보험제도는 피해자 보호에 너무 치중하는 나머지 보험사기에 쉽게 노출될 수 있다는 단점을 보완해야 한다. 이런 문제점들을 해결하기 위해서는 사이버 보안에 있어 전문 인력의 확충과 양성을 통한 조직적이고 전문적인 조사와 수사체계를 구축해야 할 것이다. 더불어서 자율주행자동차 사고 보험사기 조사 조직을 일원화하고 일선 수사기관에 전담조직을 설치 운영함으로써 보험사기를 미연에 방지하려는 노력이 필요하다. 이러한 노력이 결실을 이룬다면 보험사기로 인해 낭비되는 사회적 비용의 절감과 더불어 선량한 보험계약자의 피해를 최소화 할 수 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

통산성은 자동차산업에 대한 자본자유화를 가능한 늦게 실시하고, 외자의 진출에 대비하기 위해 국내 자동차기업간의 합병 등을 통한 산업재편성정책을 추진했다. 이 정책은, 당시 일본 자동차산업이 규모의 경제를 발휘하는 데 충분한 생산규모에 도달하지 못하는 등 국제경쟁력이 취약하다는 인식에 근거했다.
1971년 4월부터 실시된 자본자유화 이후에도 일본 자동차산업은 큰 영향을 받지 않았다. 이는 정부의 산업재편성 정책이 성공해서가 아니라, 이미 외국기업의 진입에 경쟁할 수 있을 정도의 경쟁력을 일본 자동차산업이 충분히 구비하고 있었기 때문이었다. 자본자유화가 논의되고 있던 1960년대 후반에 일본 자동차산업은 급속한 생산성 향상을 통해 경쟁력을 높였는데, 통산성은 그 실상을 파악하지 못한 채 1960년대 초반의 상황에 근거해 정책을 실시하였던 것이다.
1970년대부터 일본 산업정책의 기조는 기존의 직접 개입에서 가이드라인 제시로 전환되었는데, 이 전환의 배경에는 이와 같은 1960년대의 경험을 통한 정부-기업간 관계의 변화가 있었다고 할 수 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

생명침해에 따른 피난 행위에 있어서는 국내·외를 막론하고 긴급피난의 성립을 부정하는 견해가 유력하다. 이것은 긴급피난 상태에 있어서도 생명법익의 침해를 금지하는 것을 관철하는 것이라고 할 수 있다. 이러한 이해를 자율주행에 따른 생명침해의 사안에 그대로 적용시킨다면, 긴급피난이 성립할 여지는 없을 수도 있다. 그렇다면 생명침해 사안에 있어서 긴급피난의 성부라고 하는 전통적 논점은 자율주행자동차의 개발자 등의 형사책임에 대한 사항이라는 현대적과제를 낳고 이는 도로교통상의 안전성 확보 등에 있어서도 상당히 중요한 부분이 될 것이다.
자율주행자동차에 따른 생명침해에 있어서는 긴급피난의 생명침해 금지완화를 허용하는 것으로 그 구제수단의 결여와 질서악화 우려를 낮아지도록 할 수가 있을 것이다. 이에 긴급피난 사례에 대해 생명침해를 특별시하는 경우에도 피해를 최소화하는 프로그램을 행한 자율주행자동차의 개발자 등에 대해서 긴급피난의 성립을 인정하는것 또한 어느 정도 가능할 것으로 보인다.
그렇지만 긴급피난의 법리에 따른 불처벌은 긴급한 상태를 규율대상으로 하는 것으로 부터 나누어지는 것이며, 그러한 본래의 내용에 대한 잠재적 해결 방안이라는 성격을 지니는 것이라고 할 수가 없다. 그러므로 자율주행자동차의 개발·보급을 촉진한다는 관점으로 허용 하는 것만으로는 그 충분한 해결방안으로 하기에는 조금 고민이 필요할 것으로 보인다.
자율주행자동차의 등장과 같은 새로운 패러다임·새로운 시대의 도래에 따라 발생하는 현대적 과제에 대해 보다 적절하고 현실적·구체적인 논의에 따른 명확화가 필요한 시점이 도래했다고 볼 수가 있다. 따라서 이에 대해 그 불처벌 요건의 명문화에 대해 충분한 논의에 입각한 입법에 따라 명확·구체화한 해결에 대한 고민을 해야 할 것으로 보이며, 이를 바탕으로 한 도로교통상의 안전성 확보방안이 강구되어야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

한편 이러한 인공지능은 수많은 사람들의 개인정보 등 다양한 데이터의 축적으로 인하여 형성되고 만약 이렇게 축적된 개인정보나 데이터 등이 한순간에 유출된다면 심각한 개인정보 침해의 위험이 초래될 우려가 있다.
사이버 공간에서 개인정보나 데이터에 대한 침해를 가하는 행위를 ‘사이버공격’이라고 부르며, 이러한 사이버공격을 받아 피해를 입을 수 있는 침해환경을 ‘사이버위험’이라고 칭한다. 최근 전 세계적으로 이러한 사이버공격으로 인한 범죄는 급속도로 증가하고 있는 추세이다.
사이버위험은 정보통신을 이용하는 시스템에 대한 모든 방해요소를 의미하며, 이러한 유형에는 많은 종류가 있지만 대표적으로 스펨메일이나 피싱 등이 있다. 특히 이러한 사이버위험은 가해자의 신원을 확인하기 어려운 경우가 많으며 전문적인 해커로 인한 사이버공격은 그 형태가 매우 치밀하고 유형도 다양하다. 또한 피해자들은 이러한 해커들의 공격에 대한 정보의 피해액을 제대로 산정하기 어려우며, 공격과 피해에 대한 인과관계도 제대로 파악하기 어렵다. 따라서 입증책임이 피해자에게 있는 법률을 통해서는 피해자가 재판을 통해 피해액을 제대로 구제받기도 쉬운 일이 아니다. 또한 입증책임이 전환된 경우라 할지라도 재판을 통해 구제를 받기 위해서는 많은 소송비용과 오랜 소요시간이 필요하다.
한편 인공지능을 갖춘 시스템이 최근 빠른 속도로 산업현장 곳곳에 투입되고 있으며 심지어 인공지능을 기반으로 한 다양한 형태를 갖춘 로봇의 등장으로 인하여 앞으로 산업환경에 커다란 변화가 일어날 것으로 예상된다. 특히 인공지능 시스템을 갖춘 자율주행자동차는 이러한 인공지능 분야에 대한 대표적인 산물이라고 보아야 할 것이다.
물론 이러한 자율주행자동차의 시스템이 상용화되기까지는 아직 많은 연구와 제도적인 뒷받침이 필요한 단계이지만 각국의 수많은 전문가가 분석한 바에 따르면, 2027년부터는 자율주행기술의 최고단계인 5단계 시스템을 갖춘 차량들이 점차 등장하기 시작할 것으로 예측되고 있다.
이러한 인공지능을 갖춘 자율주행자동차의 시스템은 운행자의 개인정보를 비롯하여 스스로 차량을 운행하기 위한 수많은 데이터를 저장하고 있는데, 만약 이러한 데이터에 대한 사이버공격이 이루어진다면 운전자 개인은 물론 교통환경 전체에도 커다란 위협이 될 것이다. 특히 자율주행자동차가 상용화되면, 일반 차량을 이용하여 고의적으로 사고를 유발시키는 보험사기의 유형이 시스템에 대한 해킹을 통해 이루어 질 것이다. 이로 인해 수많은 전문 해커들이 등장하게 될 수 있을 것이며 이러한 해커들이 의도적으로 시스템에 대한 사이버공격을 가한다면 교통환경 전체의 위험은 물론 모든 운전자의 개인정보 침해에 대한 문제도 심각하게 대두될 수 있다.
따라서 자율주행자동차의 사이버공격에 대한 위험성을 유형별로 철저히 분석하고 이에 대한 법적 ? 제도적 방안을 시급하게 마련해야 한다.

2018,한국 자동차부품산업의 질적 무역경쟁력 연구 - 일본과의 무역을 중심으로 - = A Study on the Qualitative Trade Competitiveness of Korea to Japan in Auto Parts Industry,"자동차부품산업, 무역적자, 비교우위, 질적 무역경쟁력, 일본, auto parts industry, trade deficit, comparative advantage, qualitative trade competitiveness, Japan","본고는 2000-2015년을 연구기간으로 하여 한국 자동차부품산업의 일본에 대한 질적무역경쟁력을 분석하였다. 연구 결과 및 시사점을 정리하면 다음과 같다.
첫째, 한국 자동차부품산업은 일본과의 무역에서 막대한 무역적자를 내고 있으며, 수출 및 수입 품목의 편중 현상도 심하며, 특히 수입 품목의 편중이 심하다. 즉, 기어 박스, 엔진, 엔진 전용 부분품의 수입 편중이 매우 심하며, 이들 품목의 대일 무역적자에 대한 부정적 기여도가 매우 크다. 둘째, 일본과의 무역에서 엔진 차체 및 섀시는 연구기간 내내비교열위에 있었다. 부분품과 부속품도 대체로 열위 품목이 많았지만 2005년 이후 비교우위로의 개선이 두드러진다. 이처럼 자동차부품산업은 일본과의 무역에서 무역적자를 기록하고 있음에도 불구하고 비교우위를 보이고 있어 다른 산업에 비해 일반적인 무역경쟁력이 지속적으로 개선되어 왔음을 알 수 있다. 그러나 셋째, 질적 무역경쟁력 분석 결과, 무역액 기준 및 품목수 기준 모두에서 2000-2015년간 수평적 사업내무역(HIIT) 및 우위품질의 산업내무역(VIIT<sup>H</sup>) 비중이 크지 않은 것으로 나타났다. 이는 자동차부품산업이 일본과의 무역에서 주로 열위품질의 품목을 수출하고 우위품질의 품목을 수입해왔음을 의미한다. 기어 박스, 엔진 및 엔진 전용의 부분품도 모두 마찬가지다. 단, 열위품질의 산업내무역(VIIT<sup>L</sup>)이 축소하고 우위품질의 산업내무역(VIIT<sup>H</sup>)이 증가하고 있어 자동차부품산업의 질적 무역경쟁력은 조금씩 개선되어 왔음을 발견할 수 있다.
따라서 일본과의 무역에서 일부 품목의 수출입 편중이라는 비정상적 무역구조를 해소하기 위한 노력과 기어 박스, 엔진, 엔진전용 부분품의 품질 향상을 위한 정부차원의 지원과 지속적인 R&D를 통한 질적 무역경쟁력 향상 및 수출입시장의 다변화가 요구된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,국내 자동차산업의 적정부채비율 추정을 위한 실증연구 = The Study on the Estimation of Optimal Debt Ratio in Korean Automobile Industry,"NFCL(net finance cost to liabilities),Optimal Debt Ratio,ROA(return of net operating income on asset),ROE(return of net operating income on equity),ROS(return of operating income on sales),TAT(total assets turnover)","본 연구는 다른 산업에 비해 국가경제에 미치는 영향이 매우 높은 자동차산업의 적정부채비율 추정을 위하여 이론적으로 도출 가능한 분석적 수리모형을 수립하고 객관적인 자료를 이용하여 적정부채비율을 추론하는데 목적이 있다. 분석모형은 부채비율을 독립변수로 하는 총자산순영업이익률, 자기자본순영업이익률의 두 계산식으로부터 출발하고 관련 모수는 총자산회전율, 매출액영업이익률, 순금융비용율로 구성하였다. 이 가운데 순금융비용율의 경우 부채비율과 1차 선형관계를 고려한 방정식을 분석모형에 추가하는 등의 분석적 절차에 따라 적정부채비율 기준을 총자산순영업이익률과 자기자본순영업이익률을 극대화하는 부채비율 수준으로 정의하였다. 이는 적정부채비율 수준을 두가지 이상의 계산식으로부터 도출된 일정 범위내의 추정값을 제시함으로써 한 개의 계산식으로 출발한 단일 추정값이 가지는 신뢰성의 문제를 어느 정도 해소할 수 있을 것이라고 판단됐기 때문이다. 이에 본 연구에서는 적정부채비율 추정을 위하여 총자산순영업이익률, 자기자본순영업 이익률에 대해서 부채비율을 독립변수로 하는 2차함수로 나타냈다. 이러한 분석절차에 의해 우리나라 자동차산업의 16개년 자료를 토대로 적정부채비율을 도출한 결과 총자산순영업이익률의 경우 188%의 부채비율과 자기자본순영업이익률의 경우 213%의 부채비율이 자동차산업의 이익을 제고하는 것으로 나타났다. 이러한 결과는 본 연구의 논리적인 이론모형에도 불구하고 그 추정값이 가지는 신뢰성의 문제를 극복하고자 도출된 결과로써 188%에서 213%의 부채비율이 자동차산업의 이익 극대화와 부채사용에 대한 위험성을 해소할 수 있다는 의미로 해석할 수 있을 것이다. 뿐만 아니라 그동안의 자동차산업의 부채비율이 추정된 범위내의 적정부채비율에 비해 비교적 낮게 형성되어 있음을 의미하는 것으로 기업이 부채비율을 관리하는 목적이 안전성 유지뿐만 아니라 수익성 확대 및 해당 업종의 특성을 고려한 대응이라고 했을 때 자동차산업 발전을 위한 장기적 관점에서 차입증대를 통한 적극적인 투자를 고려해야 할 필요가 있음을 시사한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

본 제도를 반영한 세법 개정취지는 업무용승용차의 합리적인 과세방안의 제도화를 통해 사적사용 방지와 고가승용차 구입을 조세를 통해 제약하는 데 있다. 업무용승용차의 사적사용 방지를 위하여 법인사업자의 경우 임직원전용보험을 가입하도록 하였으며 운행일지 작성을 하도록 하였다. 또한 업무용 사용과 비업무용 사용을 나누기 위하여 운행일지 작성을 의무화 하였다. 업무용승용차 과세제도에서 운행일지 작성이 매우 중요해졌지만 과도한 납세협력비용이 발생하고 운행일지 검증의 효율성 문제도 제기된다. 고가승용차 구입에 대한 제재를 위하여 감가상각방법을 정액법, 내용연수 5년으로 정하고 연한도 800만원을 초과하는 감가상각비는 손금불산입한 후 한도액이 미달할 차후연도 손금으로 산입하도록 하였다. 처분할 때 처분손실이 일시에 손금산입되는 것을 방지하기 위하여 처분손실에도 연간 한도를 두었다. 이로 인해 차량이 없음에도 불구하고 장기간 처분손실을 이연하여 인식해야 하는 문제점이 발생한다.
업무용승용차 과세제도는 법인세와 소득세 분야에서 이루어졌으며 주로 사적사용 방지와 고가승용차를 통한 과도한 비용처리를 방지하기 위한 개정이었으나 꾸준히 제기된 부가가치세법의 개정은 이루어지지 않았다. 부가가치세법에서 비영업용소형승용차 매입세액불공제 규정을 두어 업무용승용차를 전부 업무용으로 사용을 하더라도 매입세액은 공제되지 않고 있다. 현행 부가가치치세법의 비영업용소형승용차 매입세액불공제 규정은 공평과세를 저해하고 부가가치세액 계산 원리에 반한다는 주장에도 불구하고 소형승용차를 사업을 위하여 사용되는 경우와 사적용도로 사용되는 경우를 과세기술상 구별해서 매입세액공제 여부를 판단하기가 매우 어렵다는 이유로 매입세액공제를 허용하고 있지 않다. 그러나 새로 도입된 업무용승용차 과세제도에서 자동차운행기록부에 의해 기업의 업무용과 사적용도를 구분하도록 하였으며 업무용 사용부분을 나눌 수 있는 구체적인 자료로 활용될 수 있으므로 비영업용승용차에 대하여 부가가치세 매입세액공제를 하지 않는 것에 대한 정당성이 약화된 결과가 되었다.
업무용승용차손금불산입 특례제도의 개선방안으로 업무전용자동차보험 가입을 의무화한 조항을 삭제하고 대신 업무전용자동차보험에 가입하지 않은 경우 가산세를 부과하는 방법을 제시하였다. 업무전용자동차보험에 가입하는 경우 배우자나 가족 등의 사용을 제한하여 사적사용을 일부분 방지할 수 있다. 그러므로 법인사업자의 경우에만 가입을 의무화한 것을 개인사업자에게도 적용할 필요가 있다. 고가승용차 구입을 제한하기 위하여 개정한 감가상각관련 규정은 폐지하는 것이 바람직하다. 업무용승용차손금불산입 특례제도가 복잡해지고 효율적이지 못한 결과가 된 것은 감가상각한도 규정과 처분손실에 손금한도를 둔 것에서 기인한다. 차량을 모두 업무용으로 사용한다면 감가상각한도 규정은...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

연구 결과, 현대자동차는 문화마케팅을 판매와 영업 성과를 향상하기 위한 수단으로 활용함과 동시에 기업과 브랜드 정체성을 차별화하기 위한 전략으로 발전시키고 있었다. 2000년대 초반에는 ‘고객’, ‘위대한 회화의 시대: 렘브란트와 17세기 네덜란드 회화전’, ‘공연’이 빈도수가 높은 단어로 추출되었다. 현대자동차가 공연 중심의 문화 행사를 고객 대상으로 개최하여, 특정 소비자 그룹에 혜택을 제공하는 방식으로 시작하였다. 2000년대 후반에 상위 노출된 단어는 ‘예술의 전당’, ‘서울시립교향악단’으로, 인지도 높은 문화예술기관의 주요 문화 행사에 후원하였다. 2010년대 초반에는 기존고객 중심에서 잠재 고객으로 대상을 넓히고, 문화마케팅을 아우르는 브랜드와 공간(‘브릴리언트’와 ‘현대아트홀’)을 선보였다. 2010년대 중후반에는 노출 빈도가 높은 ‘브랜드’와 ‘글로벌’에서 보여주듯, 문화마케팅의 초점이 고객에서 브랜드 구축으로, 국내에서 글로벌로 확장되고 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  첫 번째로 생각해볼 수 있는 것은 본 규정이 TBT 협정 부속서 제1.1조에서 규정하고 있는 ‘기술규정’인지여부를 먼저 살펴봐야 할 것이다. 애초부터 기술규정이 아니라면 TBT 협정 위반여부를 다툴 여지가 없기 때문이다. 두 번째로 사이버보안규정의 제정이 TBT 협정 제2.2조에서 언급하고 있는 ‘정당한 목적’ 달성을 위한 조치인지와 그러한 조치가 ‘필요한 조치’인지 여부를 검토해보아야 할 것이다. 끝으로 사이버보안규정이 국제사회에서 공통으로 적용할 수 있는 공인된 ‘표준’이 존재하는지 아니면 적어도 그 표준의 완성이 임박했는지 여부를 검토해보아야 할 것이다.
  상기 언급한 세 가지 쟁점에 대한 판단을 위해 그간 WTO 분쟁해결기구에 제소되었던 사안들 중에 위의 쟁점들을 살펴보는데 적합한 3건의 사례를 통해 패널과 상소기구에서 언급된 내용들을 검토해보는 것은 의미가 있는 작업이라 생각된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EU는 교토의정서이후 전 세계 기후변화 대응에서 모범을 보여왔다. EU차원의 기후변화 대응과 EU내 산업 구조조정을 통해서 제조업분야가 EU의 온실가스 배출에서 차지하는 비중은 줄어들었다. 이후운송분야가 에너지 산업분야 다음의 EU의 온실가스 배출분야로 부상하였다. EU와 EU회원국은 운송분야에서 온실가스 배출을 줄이기 위해서 지속적으로 정책개발을 하였다. EU가 운송분야 온실가스 배출을 감축하기 위한 정책제시와 법안채택을 하였다. EU의 “2020 기후·에너지 패키지(2020 Climate and Energy Package)”, 2050 저탄소 경제 로드맵(A Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050)의 목표달성을 위해서는 운송분야에서 저탄소차량의 이용확대를 필요로 하였다. 또한 2011년에 발표된 EU집행위원회 백서인 “단일 유럽 교통지역 로드맵(Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area)”에서 2050년까지 교통부문 온실가스 배출을 1990년 대비 최소한 60% 감축한다는 목표가 제시되었다. 또한, 도심에서 재래식연료 사용(conventionally fuelled) 차량을 2030년까지 50% 수준으로 감소하고, 2050년까지는 완전 퇴출(phase out)하는 전략도 제시되었다. EU의 기후변화 대응 정책 뿐만아니라 EU 주요도시에서 질소산화물 배출의 주범이 도로운송분야이기 때문에 EU는 내연기관의 배출가스 규제를 보다 더욱 강화하면서 친환경 모빌리티의 확산을 유도하고 있다. 운송분야에서 탄소배출과배출가스를 억제하려는 EU의 정책에 힘입어 EU에서 전기자동차 구입은 확대되었다. 그러나EU회원국의 전기자동차 이용현황은 회원국별로 상이하였고, EU회원국 별로 전기자동차 충전소 등 전기자동차 인프라 구축에도 큰 차이가 있었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,ICT와 사회의 ‘융합’을 위한 사회적 합의 프레임워크- 인공지능과 자율주행자동차를 중심으로 = Social Consensus Framework for Convergence of ICT and Society ?

이 글은 이러한 관점에서 2016 세계경제포럼 이후 ‘4차산업혁명’이라고 일컬어지며 인류의 생활과 사회에 대한 또 한 번의 급격한 변화를 예고하고 있는 기술혁신과 사회의 상호작용에 대해 4차산업혁명에서 일반적으로 이야기 되는 ‘기술 융합’을 넘어 ‘기술과 사회의 융합’의 확장적 모델을 제시하고자 했다. 4차산업혁명의 핵심 기술기반은 3차 산업혁명 이후 지속적으로 축적, 발전되어 온 데이터와 컴퓨팅 파워를 기반으로 한 인공지능(AI) 기술이며 이를 응용하고 서로 연결하여 새로운 차원의 미래사회의 모습을 예측하게 하는 사물인터넷(IoT)을 비롯한 다양한 영역에서 활용될 기반기술이다. 최근 앞다투어 발행되고 있는 미국, 유럽, OECD의 보고서는 인공지능 사회가 가져올 다양한 사회적 편익과 위험에 대해 실제적으로 고민하고 그에 기반한 원칙을 제시하고 기술의 발전은 이를 지향해야 하며 이 과정에서 다양한 이해관계자 사이의 사회적 합의가 필수적임을 공히 제시하고 있다.

MIT 미디어랩의 모럴 머신 웹사이트는 이런 딜레마 상황에 관한 사람들의 의식을 광범위하게 조사하는 기여를 했지만, 그 결과를 공공의 합의라고 보는 것은 부당하고, 위험하다. 또한 Lin(2015)이 주장하는 것처럼, 불가피한 충돌 사고의 상황에서 자율주행시스템이 특정한 유형의 선택을 하도록 프로그램 하는 것은 특정한 속성을 지닌 사람들을 충돌의 피해자로 표적화하는 것에 해당하기 때문에 정당화되기 어렵다는 난점이 있다. 이 논문은, 자율주행에 관한 규범이 궁극적으로 사회적 결정의 문제임을 인정하는 한에서, 인공시스템이 유능하고 사려 깊은 인간 운전자를 대신하도록 해도 좋다는 확신이 들 때까지 5단계 자율주행기술의 허용은 보류되어야 한다고 주장한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

자동차보험 ‘자기차량손해’ 담보종목에서 쌍방과실 사고로 자기차량에 손해가 발생한 경우 일반적으로 피보험자는 자기 보험자에게 손해액 전부를 청구하여 보상을 받는다. 이때 보험자는 계약에서 정한 자기부담금을 공제한 보험금을 지급한다. 그리고 보험자는 상대방에게 대위권을 행사하여 상대 차의 과실에 해당하는 금액을 회수하게 된다.
그런데 최근에 잇따르고 있는 하급심 판결들에서는 보험자가 대위권을 행사할 때 피보험자가 부담하기로 했던 자기부담금에 해당하는 금액을 남겨두고 그 나머지 금액만을 청구할 수 있다고 하고 있다. 그렇다면 남겨둔 자기부담금에 해당하는 그 금액은 피보험자가 다시 손해배상청구권을 행사하여 받을 수 있다는 것이다. 이렇게 되면 결과적으로 피보험자는 자기부담금 없이 모든 손해를 보장받게 되는 것이다. 이런 판결들로 인해 일부 언론과 유투버들은 마치 보험회사가 고객의 돈을 떼먹은 것처럼 보도하여 부정적인 인식이 확산되고 있다.
하급심의 이런 판결들은 대법원 전원 합의체 판결을 그 근거로 들고 있다. 이에 이 논문에선 대법원의 이 판결은 화재보험의 일부보험에 관한 판결로서 자동차보험 자기부담금에 적용되어서는 안 된다는 점을 밝혔다.
그럼에도 불구하고 하급심 판결처럼 분쟁의 소지가 있다면 자동차보험 약관을 개정하여 보다 구체적인 규정을 두는 것이 좋겠기에 약관개정안을 제시하였다.
다만, 현재 보험실무에서는 상대 차의 과실의 많고 적음을 따지지 않고 최저 자기부담금을 적용하고 있는데 이 점은 불합리하다고 생각한다. 그래서 이 부분에 대한 개선안도 함께 제시하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this period, the goal of industrial policy was basically import substitution industrialization of automotive industry. e policy direction for the goal was to achieve the automobile manufacturers’ economies of scale through entry regulation and to increase the proportion of parts produced domestically.
  The rst policy was the Automotive Industry 5-Year Plan of 1962, backed legally by the Automotive Industry Protection Act, is act limited the number of companies entering the automotive business. to achieve economies of scale. And it gradually led to increase the proportion of parts of domestic production. However, the policy failed to achieve the goal, due to the unsystematic policy tools and the ‘rent seeking’ strategy of the automobile assemblers.
  The long-term automotive industry enhancement plan of 1974 appeared in the process of trial and error to solve these problems of the 1960s. In this plan, an incentive system was established in which the assembler could invest boldly to achieve economies of scale and use domestic parts. As a result, it has become possible to produce vehicles using domestic parts, in the late of 1970s. However, not all goals of policy were realized as intended. Moreover, the side eects of the policy have led to the rationalization of the automotive industry in 1980s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

첫 번째로 생각해볼 수 있는 것은 본 규정이 TBT 협정 부속서 제1.1조에서 규정하고 있는 ‘기술규정’인지여부를 먼저 살펴봐야 할 것이다. 애초부터 기술규정이 아니라면 TBT 협정 위반여부를 다툴 여지가 없기 때문이다. 두 번째로 사이버보안규정의 제정이 TBT 협정 제2.2조에서 언급하고 있는 ‘정당한 목적’ 달성을 위한 조치인지와 그러한 조치가 ‘필요한 조치’인지 여부를 검토해보아야 할 것이다. 끝으로 사이버보안규정이 국제사회에서 공통으로 적용할 수 있는 공인된 ‘표준’이 존재하는지 아니면 적어도 그 표준의 완성이 임박했는지 여부를 검토해보아야 할 것이다.

In general, the vehicle seat’s ride comfort design includes static support for sitting posture and dynamic isolation of floor level vibration. The pattern analysis of a measured sitting pressure distribution provides a design evaluation of the static support, while the body""s force transfer is for the dynamic isolation of the excitation vibration. An essential evaluation of the seat design occurs mainly after the prototype becomes available in the current vehicle design process.

As a result, air pollution in Thailand is serious and the Thai government has announced that it will replace 22,000 electric two-wheeled vehicles by 2025. Although it is desirable to manufacture a two-wheeled vehicle in the structure of an electric two-wheeled vehicle that does not generate emissions, the northern region of Thailand has a chronic power shortage problem despite the high electricity supply rate. Therefore, it is realistic to manufacture a two-wheeled vehicle with some structural changes. The existing two-wheeled vehicle is driven by a gasoline engine, but the structure of the modified vehicle is a method of applying a series hybrid drive system and using a motor while driving the vehicle. The motor uses the electrical energy of the battery, and when the capacity of the battery is reduced below a certain level, the engine is operated and the generator starts to charge the battery. There is an advantage in that emissions can be reduced because the engine operates in certain situations. In this paper, the energy efficiency data of the two-wheeled vehicle and the restructured two-wheeled vehicle, which is the main transport in Thailand, were constructed using MATLAB Simulink.

Conventional turbocharged boosting system in an internal combustion engine dedicated vehicle grants fuel economy benefits thanks to engine downsizing. In a HEV, an electric motor governs the operating region of the engine, limiting the fuel economy benefits of said downsizing approach. Moreover, turbocharging reduces exhaust energy for the catalytic converter while increasing the back pressure, leading to adverse effects on emissions and fuel economy. This paper discusses the HEVdedicated Miller Cycle engine, which can boost the intake pressure without increasing the back pressure. In addition, the energy of the exhaust gas can be used in its entirety for the catalytic converter, thus favorable for emission reduction. An intake manifold integrated with a water-cooled intercooler was used, lowering the volumetric efficiency while realizing high charge cooling effects.

Until now, advanced driver assistant systems (ADASs) and self-driving technologies have been researched to cope with diverse possible scenarios. Among them, car-following driving has been formed the groundwork of autonomous vehicle for its integrity and flexibility to other modes such as smart cruise system (SCC) and platooning. Although the field has a rich history, most researches has been focused on the shape of target trajectory, such as the order of interpolated polynomial, in simple single-lane situation. However, to introduce the car-following mode in urban environment, realistic situation should be reflected: multi-lane road, target’s unstable driving tendency, obstacles. Therefore, the suggested car-following system includes both in-lane preceding vehicle and other factors such as side-lane targets. The algorithm is comprised of three parts:path candidate generation and optimal trajectory selection. In the first part, initial guesses of desired paths are calculated as polynomial function connecting host vehicle’s state and vicinal vehicle’s predicted future states. In the second part, final target trajectory is selected using quadratic cost function reflecting safeness, control input efficiency, and initial objective such as velocity. Finally, adjusted path and control input are calculated using model predictive control (MPC).

There is a voltage distortion between the reference and actual voltage due to non-ideal switching characteristics. Measured phase voltages are used as inputs of the position estimator instead of the reference voltages in order to reduce the position estimation errors that have increased at a lower speed. In order to remove the high frequency switching components of a pulse width modulation inverter, a low pass filter(LPF) with a proper cut-off frequency is indispensable; however, the LPF causes gain attenuation and phase delay. The compensation method of the attenuation and delay is implemented by simple arithmetic operations based on the orthogonal property of the measured voltages in a two-axis stationary reference frame. The compensation method is applied to the sensorless drives of an electric oil pump for automotive transmissions that require very low speed drives of pumps at a subzero oil temperature.

The effectiveness of AEB on actual roads is the basic data for improving the performance of AEB and calculating the vehicle insurance premium. This paper presents the collision avoidance effect of AEB by means of a meta-analysis method. Meta-analysis is a statistical method used for deriving a comprehensive conclusion based on several studies. In order to estimate the effectiveness of AEB by applying the meta-analysis method, the accident data from Korean auto insurance companies are used. As a result, among the same model vehicles, the accident rate of a vehicle with an AEB was approximately 10 % to 17 % smaller than that of a vehicle without an AEB.
The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of AEB’s actual accident prevention for domestic vehicles lacking in statistical verification studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This torsional vibration causes NVH problems and affects the life of the vehicle. DMF system based on torsional stiffness and inertia provided an effective capacity of releasing irregular vibration rising from the engine and transmitting to the transmission. However, engine irregularities have become more serious as a result of downsizing and uptorquing. The DMF system based on stiffness and inertia has reached its limits. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to propose new systems. Centrifugal pendulum and its application in the automotive area is considered as a major breakthrough. They are capable of counteracting the applied torque fluctuations of a given frequency over a range of operating amplitude, which turns out to be an efficient tool for filtration. In this study, we have shown the behaviors of the DMF pendulum in front wheel driveline with a seven-speed dual wet-clutch transmission. We designed a driveline rotor model and analyzed the frequency vibration. The contribution analysis was performed on each design factor of DMF, pendulum, and driveline system.

Also, precision is relatively low due to the absence of separate devices for correcting errors. To solve these problems, an estimation algorithm was proposed to reduce uncertainty in the location information from GPS, and to obtain a high frequency data rate that would be suitable to control the vehicle. Unlike existing position estimation methods, the proposed algorithm considered both the error in the in-vehicle sensor and the delay in the output signal of the GPS to improve accuracy while still using a simple and effective tracking algorithm.

This mode, which is a button, pull-out fracture, remains as a weld nugget, and a sheet metal leads to tearing in the HAZ(Heat Affected Zone). It affects structural performance after losing a connection force and tearing a sheet metal around the spot weld. Recently, many studies have been attempted to apply the FFLD(Fracture Forming Limit Diagram) failure criteria to the HAZ and sheet metal. Various mesh pattern sizes were tested around the spot weld. LS-Dyna was used for the seat/belt anchorage analysis of this paper. In the LS-Dyna calculation, the presence of dynamic effects on minimization yielded a good correlation with the quasi static test. The developed FFLD curve was applied to a sheet metal, while heat affected the zone around the spot weld to achieve a good correlation instead of an effective plastic strain. The 16 hexa mesh dependent was applied to show a similar shape of the spot weld and a sheet metal fracture in the seat/belt anchorage test.

In this stage, prediction results on the drag coefficient and surface pressure on the center line of a bus body were compared with those of wind tunnel tests. Second, numerical simulations have been carried out for the actual bus model with a detailed air conditioning system to evaluate aerodynamic drag and the effect of ventilation. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that simulation results regarding surface pressure and drag force work well with wind tunnel test results.

Numerous parameters in the ECU function have to be calibrated in order to convert the sensor value to air charge load. Manual calibration is time consuming or even impossible due to the high number of correlated parameters. Tiers supplying an ECU make use of internal parameter optimizers not only for the air charge function, but also for some other functions. However, these optimizers are not generally opened to third parties so as to protect intellectual property. In this study, a generic parameter optimizer, MOCA, has been utilized in order to simulate the air charge function and to optimize the calibration parameters for minimizing the deviation between the measured actual output and the model output. Optimum results by MOCA were almost the same as the results of the Tier internal optimizer.

The speed before impact is the most important factor in the case of a vehicle-to-vehicle collision. If it is possible to retrieve the EDR data, its impact speed can be extracted easily. Otherwise, we need to calculate the impact speed by using some evidence. This paper reconstructed the vehicle accident by utilizing the PC-CRASH collision optimal function with the damaged spot of the vehicle and the final stop position of the cars.

The path planning for lane change is proceeded in two phases. In phase 1, a path is generated with line information at each time step. When the host vehicle enters the transition area between the two lanes, the line information sometimes has a low reliability.

As of 2019, many vehicles have been released to the public, which has led to a large structural mass difference between small, medium and large vehicles. Also, the geometry of the front of the vehicle is completely different for each vehicle and tends not to be perfectly aligned at frontal collisions. The difference in mass of each of these vehicles and less performing structures for offset crashes have led to dramatically worse outcome in a car to car offset frontal impact tests. Even though a decade later passenger cars have become much safer due to consumer test programs and regulatory requirements, the aggressiveness and compatibility that can cause damage to the opponent car in the event of car to car collision is not considered in the above-mentioned section, and therefore much improvement is needed. After many years of study to solve this problem, EuroNCAP has developed a new mode MPDB offset front test that considers the aggressiveness and compatibility that can affect the opponent cars that have collided.

In particular, a large steering angle generates large bode side slip angle, and, as a result, vehicle speed is reduced because of the lateral tire force on the longitudinal direction. The model predictive control method has been used in the high level guidance of autonomous vehicles after using a kinematic model in many studies. However, the kinematic model does not take into account the effect of steering on the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle under extreme maneuver. In this paper, we developed a model predictive controller for the extreme maneuvers of an autonomous driving vehicle, in which the influence of steering on the longitudinal acceleration is considered during cornering. As a result, the vehicle maximized its dynamic performance by utilizing friction force to the limit, which was verified by reducing the lap time of the experimental scale car on the track with many sharp corners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result of the odds ratio analysis shows that the risk of serious injury of vehicles carrying out a KNCAP is significantly 0.65 times smaller than the vehicles that are not carrying out a KNCAP. In the logistic regression model, the relationship between the occurrence of a serious accident(MAIS 3+) and the frontal impact score was analyzed.

NOx conversion efficiency according to SCR catalyst aging was also measured and analyzed. As a result of the measurement of the NOx reduction efficiency of the SCR catalyst, the reduction efficiency improves as the temperature rises. Reduction efficiency shows a slight decrease when the temperature exceeds 500 °C.

However, it is difficult to clearly estimate the braking performance due to minute differences(e.g., material and pattern of the tire) because the breaking performance of a car varies according to the combination and operating conditions of the different parts. In particular, the braking performance of a tire on icy roads varies significantly depending on the ice sheet uniformity of the proving ground, and the uncertainty of the performance evaluation becomes even bigger. Furthermore, the time constraints and high cost of the icy road proving ground make it difficult to perform systematic and diverse test matrices. In this study, a fundamental test method is introduced in order to evaluate the braking performance of car tires through a friction test by using a uniform ice prepared in the laboratory. In addition, various frictional coefficients were measured and analyzed according to the changes in travel speed, vertical load, contact area between tire and road surface, ambient temperature, and number of friction braking events.

This function turns off the engine when the vehicle is stopped. It helps to improve the fuel efficiency by reducing fuel waste by idling. However, if you turn off the engine at a stop, the mechanical oil pump(MOP) and the flow will also stop. For this reason, the flow rate required for the power circulation is supplied through the electric oil pump(EOP), and power loss occurs. Power loss through the use of additional oil pumps affects fuel economy, as well as the capacity of the oil pump used. Therefore, power loss through the use of an oil pump must be considered in a fuel economy analysis. In this study, the fuel consumption analysis was performed while considering the power loss of the oil pump by using the backward simulation.

There is a voltage distortion between the reference and actual voltage due to non-ideal switching characteristics.

In order to remove the high frequency switching components of a pulse width modulation inverter, a low pass filter(LPF) with a proper cut-off frequency is indispensable; however, the LPF causes gain attenuation and phase delay. The compensation method of the attenuation and delay is implemented by simple arithmetic operations based on the orthogonal property of the measured voltages in a two-axis stationary reference frame.

The majority of the drivers who experienced SUA accident insisted that they hardly pressed the brake pedal. However, upon inspection of the vehicle, it is found a broken acceleration pedal, a stuck acceleration pedal in the pad, and a footprint on the acceleration pedal. In America, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration(NHTSA) announced the 49 CFR Part 563 from September 1, 2012 to recommend the installation of the Event Data Recorder(EDR) and the standard data. A similar enforcement decree with Part 563 was announced in December 19, 2015 in Korea. According to the enforcement decree of EDR, it is allowed to retrieve a record of the driver’s operation before the event triggered. In addition, the installation of the digital tachograph(DTG) is regulated for business purpose vehicles on January 1, 2014. The possibility of a driver’s incorrect pedal operation could be validated through DTG data analysis, video data record(VDR) in vehicles, and CCTV records. In the 269 cases of SUA in 6 years(2013 to 2018), 203 cases were confirmed to be the driver""s pedal maloperation and 173 cases involved drivers in their 50s and older. In the 203 cases involving driver""s maloperation, the broken pedal and the jammed pedal with the vehicle mat case were confirmed. Therefore, it is required to improve vehicle safety system, regulation, and advanced driver training for preventing the maloperation of the acceleration pedal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PA6 is known for its capacity to absorb moisture in the air. The water absorption of PA6 specimens were predicted by using Fick’s law of diffusion. The effects of test temperature and water absorption on the elastic modulus of PA6 were investigated. Dry specimens, as well as specimens immersed in water for 3 and 16 days, were tested in order to find elastic modulus at temperatures from -60 to 95 °C. As the test temperature increased, the elastic modulus decreased. As the water content increased, the elastic modulus decreased at temperatures above freezing point because the absorbed water acted as a plasticizer. However, as the water content increased, the elastic modulus increased at temperatures below freezing point. The water molecules that have been absorbed in PA6 have turned into ice crystals at temperatures below freezing point. Furthermore, the high elastic modulus of the ice crystals increased the elastic modulus of PA6, which absorbed the water molecules. The elastic modulus of PA6 was predicted at temperatures below freezing point by using the rule of mixture. The result showed that the measured elastic modulus was higher than expected. This difference became larger as the water content increased. The increased elastic modulus with the increased water content at test temperatures below freezing point is due to the strong bonding force between the PA6 polymer chain structure and the ice crystals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DMF system based on torsional stiffness and inertia provided an effective capacity of releasing irregular vibration rising from the engine and transmitting to the transmission. However, engine irregularities have become more serious as a result of downsizing and uptorquing. The DMF system based on stiffness and inertia has reached its limits. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to propose new systems. Centrifugal pendulum and its application in the automotive area is considered as a major breakthrough.

In order to verify the technological feasibility, an X-ray imaging of the DPF removed from the driving vehicle was conducted by using an X-ray generator, as well as an IP reader and a CR reader. Optimal irradiation conditions were established for each DPF size. Verification of images acquired under optimal irradiation conditions confirmed the possibility of diagnosis for damages, such as crack, melting, and hollow damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main injection timing of the PCCI combustion was selected based on the simultaneous reduction of nitrogen oxides(NOX) and unburned hydrocarbon(UHC) emissions at an exhaust gas recirculation(EGR) rate of 30 %. Despite the main injection timing chosen, too advanced combustion phasing resulted in increased fuel consumption. Therefore, combustion phasing was effectively retarded by an additional EGR. Double injection strategy was implemented to reduce in-cylinder wall wetting. The UHC and carbon monoxide(CO) emissions were significantly reduced by optimizing pilot injection timing and quantity. In conclusion, the UHC and CO emissions were reduced effectively in the PCCI combustion using the double injection strategy and appropriate EGR rate, which resulted in increased combustion efficiency and improved fuel economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A commercial vehicle requires a larger number of transmission steps than a passenger vehicle because the traveling load varies depending on the cargo load amount and the road surface condition. In the multi-speed transmission system, many shifts occur within a short time under low-speed and low-load conditions. Therefore, proper skip-shift control is required. In this study, the skip-shift control strategy of multi-speed transmission vehicles was studied, and the logic was verified through simulation.

The test results were then compared and analyzed. The results showed increasing interlaminar shear strength until the manufacturing pressure condition of 3 MPa, but the strength started to decrease from the manufacturing pressure condition of 5 MPa. In the case of high elongation resins like polypropylene, the interfacial shear test showed less accuracy than the ILSS test because there was no interfacial fracture due to inelastic deformation. Similar to the result of the single-lap shear test, the interfacial shear strength tended to decrease at 5 MPa in the ILSS test.

Gas fuels like natural gas and hydrogen are currently regarded as promising alternative fuels whose use can resolve both the aforementioned problems, and there industry and engine research centers are exerting much effort to make these gas fuels viable for use in engines. This work was motivated by the desire to gain further insights into the characteristics of the low-pressure gas jet. Experimental gas jet investigation was successfully conducted through the schlieren technique, using a solenoid-valve injector with a maximum injection pressure of 0.8 MPa(absolute pressure) driven by a standard injector driver. Its supply voltage is 12 V, and its opening time, 1.4 ms. The injection pressure has a significant effect on the jet penetration. Also, a higher injection pressure leads to longer jet tip penetration. A high injection pressure leads to a higher jet momentum and higher turbulence energy, which means that the fuel-air mixing rate can be increased by increasing the injection pressure.

In a pedestrian accident, both the impact position of the pedestrian and vehicle velocity just before the impact are important factors that need to be calculated. The accident is reliably recreated through the MADYMO simulation by using the speed before the impact, the injured area of the pedestrian, and the damaged state of the vehicle. However, the reliability and utilization of MADYMO are not yet confirmed. Therefore, this paper recreated the accident by using MADYMO in order to demonstrate the reliability and utilization of the simulation results under the situation where the accident video exists. The initial impact position and dummy posture were set by using accident videos and photos of the damaged vehicle. Furthermore, vehicle speed was calculated by investigating the accident video and considering the thrown distance of the pedestrian.

A static obstacle is important since it is utilized to path planning and decision. Several established approaches generate static obstacle map by grid method and counting algorithm. However, these approaches are occasionally ineffective since the density of LiDAR layer is low. Our approach solved this problem by applying probability theory. First, we converted all LiDAR point to Gaussian distribution to considers an uncertainty of LiDAR point. This Gaussian distribution represents likelihood of obstacle. Second, we modeled dynamic transition of a static obstacle map by adopting the Hidden Markov Model. Due to the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle in relation to the conditions of the next stage only, a more accurate map of the obstacles can be obtained using the Hidden Markov Model. Experimental data obtained from test driving demonstrates that our approach is suitable for mapping static obstacles.

The heat release rate of the PU foam was decreased with increasing EG content(up to an 83 % decrease at an 18 wt% EG content). This is a relatively slower rate than that of the conventional PU foams. This may be attributed to the fact that EG may be expanded, and as such, there is a higher chance of hindering the oxygen and heat flow at an elevated temperature. The limited oxygen index and thermal conductivity were increased with increasing additive content. In general, the PU-EG composite foam containing 7 % EG provided the most satisfactory sound absorption coefficient among all the foams that were experimented on in this study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, detailed knowledge of the flow field around the corner vane was essential in improved fuel efficiency and reduced dirt contamination on the vehicle body surface. In the case of trucks driving off-road and on a wet road, dust generated by tire/soil interaction spoiled not only the vehicle’s appearance, but also the safety of the field of view due to adhesion to the body surface, side windows, and exterior mirrors. The main goal of the research was to establish an unsteady state simulation process and to gain a better understanding of dirt contamination mechanisms after considering the effect of natural wind systems. This paper discussed a collaborative effort where a CFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics) method was first validated upon road testing and then applied to a new design study. Based on off-road driving tests, it was observed that the main stream causing the dirt contamination phenomenon was determined by the interaction between the dispersed flow inside the wheel house and the intermittent inflow stream from the lower part of the engine room. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that a complex, three-dimensional vortex could occur around the wheel house region, and noticeable outflow was also observed in the front upper part of the rotating tire.

However, most of the commercial GPS-RTK(with DR) products are too expensive to be adopted in automotive systems. Therefore, this paper proposed a low-cost vehicle position estimation system, including a fusion algorithm that uses only a low-cost GPS-RTK module, wheel pulse, and IMU sensors. To implement the RTK-DR fusion algorithm, this paper also proposed a correction method to real-time sensor data, a GPS position validation method, and a DR estimation method.

Particularly, the prediction of engine performance in a driven vehicle scenario would be the most basic requirement in setting an engine operating strategy, effectively matching it with a driving system, and improving performance by controlling engine operation on an actual road. In the case of diesel engines, both fuel consumption during transient driving and the optimization of NOx performance are highly important technical tasks. In the case of diesel engines, optimization of NOx performance would be quite challenging, as well as fuel consumption during transient driving. Therefore, this paper provided a simple computational concept to simulate the fuel consumption and NOx performance of a diesel engine in a transient operating mode, which was expected to be relatively easy to apply for various purposes. To establish the transient operation calculation method proposed in this study, the differences between the transient operation of the diesel engine gas circulation system and the operational characteristics of the diesel engine’s gas circulation system under the steady state were examined, based on the engine experiment. To simplify the calculation process, it was suggested that the results of the steady state model must be adjusted to that of a transient state. Finally, the results of the comparison between the predicted calculation results of transient fuel consumption and NOx emissions, and the experimental results were presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The algorithm was designed for the FVSA(Forward Vehicle Start Alarm) function, a newly required ADAS function. We created independent nearby and distant detectors to compensate for the massive appearance variation of a vehicle because of distance between the target vehicle and the camera. The proposed detectors were designed with Haar-Like Adaboost and tested against independent nearby and distant data. To reduce false positive among the candidates caught by the detector, a pre-generated mask was used in filtering. Next, the candidate vehicle was verified with nearby and distant classifiers. The classifier was a tested HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature of SVM(Support Vector Machine). Tracking is then used to extract a particular car within a video, and if nearby and distant candidates were extracted at the same time, a correct candidate would be created by a Selection and Merge process through a calculated IOU value.

One of the major issues of particle filtering-based localization affecting the estimation accuracy is the inaccurate particle distribution-induced degeneracy. Various approaches have been suggested in order to minimize the effect of particle degeneracy. However, the approaches are not applicable for mass-production vehicles because they often require complex calculations. This paper proposes a method for reducing particle degeneracy by using the lane number obtained from the digital map when particle filtering is applied to highway localization via digital map. If the driving lane is not determined and the number of detected particle clusters is equal to that of the lanes on the driving road, the proposed method performs a separate resampling for each particle cluster.

In the engine test, the range of stable operation was slightly reduced with the application of the enhanced tumble flow, but the coefficient of variance of indicated mean effective pressure(IMEP) was lowered. IMEP was increased because the enhanced tumble flow can promote the mixture formation process, so that the local rich mixture region will decrease and the combustion speed will become faster.

The conical surface clutch part engages with the synchronizer rings by creating a cone friction torque on its conical surface. In addition, the gear part meshes with the sleeve by aligning the gear teeth with the sleeve inner splines at the end of the shifting process. First, the clutch body gear and main components of the synchronizer are designed into 3D CAD models by disassembling and reverse engineering a conventional dual clutch transmission. The friction parameters for engaging dynamic simulation are obtained from the test bench. Then, varying the tooth shape of clutch body gear and multi-body dynamic analysis are performed by using ADAMS in order to investigate the engagement characteristics during the shifting processes. The overall shifting performance and characteristics are discussed based on the simulation results. It is therefore concluded that the shape of the clutch body gear tooth can affect the shifting shock rather than the shifting force on the synchronizer sleeve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, the 1.4 L turbo gasoline direct injection engine was modified and the CNG fuel injection system was installed. The CNG fuel injector is mounted on the intake manifold for each cylinder and the fuel rail pressure was controlled at 0.7 MPa. The position of the TWC was mounted approximately 100 cm behind the exhaust manifold. Regardless of the catalyst compositions and deterioration degree, the optimal exhaust gas lambda considering all the conversion efficiencies of THC, CH₄, CO, and NOx was found at 0.98, which shifted from the lambda 1.0 for conventional gasoline engine TWC. This is probably due to the steam reforming reaction and the water-gas shift reaction that are more obvious in CNG engine operating conditions. Increasing the noble metal content and the improvement of Oxygen Storage Capacity have a significant effect on the improvement of the purification performance of THC and CH₄, rather than CO and NOx. Due to the catalytic deterioration, the conversion efficiency of THC and CH₄ was drastically reduced compared to CO and NOx.

Even though a high portion of hydrogen leads to an extended lean limit and exhibits shorter burn duration, the thermal efficiency at IMEP 3 bar deteriorates due to its high pumping loss at low excess air ratios. The maximum indicated thermal efficiency of 39.2 % and 38.2 % were achieved at WOT and IMEP 3 bar in the lean region, respectively.

In order to comply with environmental regulations, lightweight technology to reduce the weight of the vehicle body is essential for improving fuel economy. The crashworthiness and NVH performance of the vehicle must be satisfied at the same time in order to meet the safety and performance requirements for the passengers. For the crashworthiness, it is necessary to apply high strength steel. However, the formability of the high strength steel is low and the application of high strength steel to the car body is limited. Hot stamping is a technology that involves heating the steel sheet over austenite transformation temperature and directly quenching it in the cold mold. It can also secure crashworthiness, as well as formability for lightweight technology. In general, a car body part consisting of various reinforcement and joining technology is required, but one-piece parts were developed by applying hot stamping technology for weight reduction and strength enhancement. In order to achieve high strength, a specific cooling rate(35 °C/s) is required for martensitic transformation in hot stamping of high strength steel. In this study, the major variables of the hot stamping process, which are the initial temperature of the steel and the mold cooling rate, were measured. In addition, the integrated type side outer, which satisfied both weight reduction and crashworthiness, was developed by evaluating the crashworthiness through the drop impact test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, there have been constant reports of vehicles regarding compliance with exhaust emission regulations for nitrogen oxides and particulate number, both in real driving emissions tests and in-lab certification tests. However, current emission regulations for carbon dioxide from vehicles are being conducted only through in-lab tests aside from a real driving emissions test. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out various research studies on the emission characteristics of carbon dioxide emitted from vehicles in real driving conditions. In this study, a small diesel vehicle was selected in order to carry out real driving tests using the portable emission measurement system(PEMS) on the routes developed by the National Institute of Environment Research(NIER). The data obtained via real driving test was classified by the 5 ㎞/h of vehicle speed section. After a vehicle speed classification, vehicle power and trip duration according to the speed section were calculated in order to obtain vehicle work. This study attempted to predict the real driving CO₂ emissions by using vehicle work. Based on the results, the correlation coefficient between the predicted CO₂ emissions and the real driving CO₂ emissions was observed to be over 0.96, which has proven to be highly reliable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, solid rotation assumptions used in the steady flow bench were examined. Then, the impulse swirl meter(ISM) measurement was compared with a particle image velocimetry(PIV) evaluation after comparing the plane velocity distribution based on the valve angle and measurement plane. In this study, the effect of the tangential velocity distribution along the radial direction on the measured torque was quantitatively evaluated. For this purpose, the effects of the evaluation center setting and axial velocity at 1.75B, or 1.75 times of the bore position apart from the bottom of the head, and 3.00B downstream plane were investigated, leading to the following conclusions. The tangential velocity distribution is mainly influenced by the valve angle in the case of the cylinder center, and the change according to the lift is not large, but the swirl center is highly irregular due to the wall effect when the radius is increased. Next, the sum of torques of the same radius does not show a significant difference below the non-dimensional radius of 0.2 regardless of the axial speed and the center setting, but it increases rapidly after the radius of 0.8, considering axial velocity. The cumulative torque increases in a very simple form, close to the theoretical curve for the cylinder center, and asymptotic for the swirl center, while this torque is quite small, up to a radius of 0.4, with virtually no impact on the final value. At the same time, torques up to a radius of 0.8 are also theoretically less than 40 % of the final value, and the actual measured value is smaller. Finally, the cumulative torque increases significantly after a radius of 0.8, and this ratio is further increased after considering axial speed, so that the torque, which is far from the center, has a dominant effect on the final torque value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then a u-line corresponding to the boundary between the road surface and objects is detected using the v-line and u-disparity histogram. The third part involves detecting an individual obstacle by constructing a two-dimensional risk map. This approach is faster and simpler than road surface fitting approaches using disparities.

To overcome these limitations, this paper uses a side-rectilinear image generated from a frontal image, in which the shape distortion of the side of vehicle has been removed.

The main purpose of CMS is to improve driver visibility in future vehicles with a more aerodynamic profile, especially during the night or under adverse weather conditions. Having a clear, unobstructed view of the vehicles and the road around you under these conditions is crucial. Heavy rain conditions can, however, result in rivulets of water flowing onto the camera lens. Once these rivulets and the pooling of water feed on the camera lens, they can significantly impair visual acuity. Having the ability to detect water management issues earlier in the design cycle is desirable to minimize the negative impact of water management features. A numerical simulation of CMS water management is highly desirable for this reason. This paper presents the application of a multiphase lattice Boltzmann CFD solver in addressing rain water management issues on a CMS of a large bus. The result of this study confirmed that the application of CMS showed a noticeable improvement in drag, and it had 8.4 % less drag at the angle of zero yaw. The key mechanism was the convergence of two rainwater streams from the bottom and outer surfaces, which generated rain water deposition at the camera lens. The parameter study showed that modified geometry resulted in different rivulet trajectories and significantly depleted rainwater deposition over the camera lens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this estimator does not fully compensate for the model’s uncertainty on slippery road conditions. To reflect the model’s uncertainty effectively, this paper is proposing a new estimator of vertical tire forces with UKF.

Rapid pressure variations on the internal and external surface of the trains are caused by these pressure wave interactions, thus resulting in the aural discomfort of passengers and the steep lateral force variations acting on the trains. Numerical results show that the internal maximum pressure variations when two trains pass by each other in the tunnel meet the safety criterion of domestic trains, and increase 1.5 to 2 times than that when one train runs in the tunnel.

The modules and face width ratios of each stage gear that satisfy the corresponding operating conditions are analytically calculated. The volume of the gear train is calculated, evaluated, and arranged using these values to determine the optimal solution for minimizing the volume, and the proposed methodology is applied to the actual model to verify its effectiveness. The design of a two-speed transmission with multiple operating conditions and constraints without complicated optimization algorithms can be optimized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, however, the air pollution is still getting worse due to the use of vehicles without post- processing devices, and of aging vehicles. In addition, during a cold start, the PM/NOX purification efficiency is lowered due to the low exhaust gas temperature. To solve this problem, SDPF(Selective Catalytic Reduction on Diesel Particulate Filter) was developed in this study by integrating SCR(Selective Catalytic Reduction) and DPF(Diesel Particulate Filter). To develop SDPF, a mixer, a diffuser angle, and a V-W/TiO2 catalyst were used, among others. To verify the effectiveness of the developed SDPF in addressing the aforementioned problem, its back pressure and PM/NOX reduction efficiency were measured using an engine dynamometer and emission test devices.

However, questions still remained on the location where it must be heat-treated and the appropriate level of induction power. Thus, numerical simulations were carried out to calculate energy absorption with regard to the heat treatment regions and induction power.

In particular, the increase of the NPR(nozzle pressure ratio) because of the high-pressure injection causes shockwave formation near the nozzle exit as well as a change in the shock patterns in the gas jet. The characteristics of gas jets are regarded as a key design factor because they have a direct influence on the amount of fuel supply into the cylinder and on the mixture formation around the nozzle exit of the gas injector. The experiments for investigating the characteristics of shockwaves, however, are very expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, a three-dimensional numerical model was developed in this study to examine the characteristics of shockwave structures and the change in the shock of the underexpanded gas jet for various injection conditions, using DES(detached eddy simulation) based on the Eulerian approach. In addition, the analysis results were verified by comparing the penetration length with the test results of the previous studies [10]. The obtained computation result is in good agreement with the experimental value, with a less than 5 % difference. It can be found that the normal pattern of repeated barrel shockwaves, the regular reflection pattern with reflection shock added, and the Mach disk pattern with Mach disk shock, are successively generated as the NPR increases. Additionally, this study investigated the effect of geometrical modification on the shock structure by comparing two different geometries: a flattened nozzle exit and an inner-stepped nozzle exit.

In order to observe the behavior of the driver and find the critical parameters for SUA detection without the risk of an accident, a special purpose driving simulator is devised, wherein the function of acceleration and braking pedals can be switched without being overlooked by drivers. In SUA situations, most drivers start to panic and keep pressing the acceleration pedal fast and hard to the limit, while some drivers manage to take their feet off the acceleration pedal upon noticing a pedal misoperation. Based on the analysis of the driver’s behavior-related parameters, pedal angular velocity is found to be the most critical indicator of SUA due to pedal misoperation.

AOH brake system is applied to commercial vehicles between 5 to 8 tons. It consists of a hydraulic system using compressed air and operates the air master to form hydraulic pressure to transfer braking power to the wheels. When the brake lines of the system applied to vehicles with high load capacity are damaged, the braking force of one shaft is lost, and the braking distance increases rapidly, leading to a big accident. Failure of the brake line occurs due to various causes such as road surface fragmentation, corrosion of the line, and aged deterioration of air brake hose. The braking force could be decreased even when a very small break in the form of a pin-hole occurs. However, it is difficult to find a part where the thickness of the line is thin due to stone pecking or corrosion generated in the pin-hole formed on the brake line located under the lower part of the vehicle by the sensory evaluation or the conventional braking force test. Accordingly, it is necessary to analyze the condition and cause of the failure of the brake line more precisely when the accident investigation of the heavy vehicles, and also to examine the necessity of the advanced test for the aged brake line.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two main objectives of a lateral controller in autonomous vehicles are maintenance of vehicle stability and tracking of the desired path. Even if the desired steering angle is immediately determined by the upper level controller, the overall controller performance is greatly influenced by the specification of steering system actuators. Since one of the major inescapable traits that affects controller performance is the time delay of the steering actuator, our work is mainly focused on finding adequate parameters of high level control algorithm to compensate these response characteristics and guarantee vehicle stability. Actual vehicle steering angle response was obtained with Electric Power Steering (EPS) actuator test subject to various longitudinal velocity. Steering input and output response analysis was performed via MATLAB system identification toolbox. The use of system identification is advantageous since the transfer function of the system is conveniently obtained compared with methods that require actual mathematical modeling of the system.

By virtue of system reliability, most commercial vehicles adopt pneumatic brake system. However, pneumatic brake systems control is more difficult than hydraulic systems due to a longer time delay and the system nonlinearity. One of the major factors in generating braking forces is the wheel slip ratio. Accordingly, the proposed ABS strategy employs the slip ratio threshold-based valve on/off control.

The magnitude of the motor torque for each pump tooth is determined by an uneven pitch formula that is widely used for mechanical vane pumps in previous studies and patents. A formula for the shape of the motor torque is proposed by analyzing the pressure fluctuations of the pump as a combination of trigonometric and exponential functions.

To investigate the knock phenomenon, it is important to measure the wall temperature because knock is mostly affected by the wall temperature of the combustion chamber. The measurement of the piston wall temperature is challenging, however, because the piston reciprocates at a very high speed during engine operation. In this study, the design procedure of the linkage system for piston temperature measurement is presented. First, the kinematics of the system was analyzed considering the practical engine application. To obtain the optimal design, a new optimization methodology was established with the modified Nelder-Mead algorithm. Thereafter, stress analysis was conducted to estimate the durability of the designed system under harsh operating conditions. As a result, the designed system was verified to have a safety factor of 2 under a 6000 rpm engine speed. The selected design was fabricated and retrofitted into the engine, and the piston wall temperature was successfully measured. It was found that the piston wall temperature was mainly affected by the liner wall temperature, not by the head wall temperature, due to the heat transfer through the piston ring and the liner wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The seatbelt that was used in this study was the ELR type. A SELD test was conducted according to the ECE R16 regulation, and the reliability of the model was confirmed by conducting comparative analysis with the MADYMO analysis model. Then an area that could be planned was set up, and simulation was performed at 5 mm intervals to find the area in which the seatbelt webbing would not deviate from the shoulder, and to check the movement of the chest. As a result, the area of the D-ring point that met the regulation was found. When the D-ring moved 5 mm in the X-axis direction, the movement of the dummy’s chest changed by about 1.30 mm; when it moved by 5 mm in the Y-axis direction, the chest movement changed by about 1.1 mm; and when it moved by 5 mm in the Z-axis direction, the chest movement changed by about 0.45 mm.

Counterpart disks used in the friction tests were collected to examinetransfer film formation. Friction test results showed that the friction coefficient did not change much with repeated braking under 500 ˚C, but the friction coefficient decreased with repeated braking at 600 ˚C. The transfer film was hardly detected under 400 ˚C, but it was well developed at high temperature of 600 ˚C. The hardness analysis of the transfer film showed that the transfer film was softer than the counterpart disk material, and its effect was considered to reduce friction coefficients. The decrease in friction coefficients with consecutive braking under 600 ˚C was attributed to the development of the transfer film with repeated braking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential of the crack originator, which is affected by the machining pattern on the frictional surface of the disk brake, became higher with pattern machining because the pattern works like a defect on the surface. In this paper, the use of the chamfer machined on the cross-drilled hole was investigated as a method of preventing crack generation. Several design parameters, such as the depth, length, and curvature of the chamfer, were selected and analyzed in accordance with the design of the experiment method, using finite-element analysis. As a result, it was revealed that crack generation was affected by the length, diameter, and depth, in descending order of major contribution. This shows that a longer, shallower, and smaller-diameter chamfer will result in a lower potential for crack generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since methane has lower carbon content, as compared to that of gasoline and diesel, in the same energy density, carbon dioxide could be reduced. In addition, it can decrease smoke emission. However, shale gas contains not only methane, but also inert gases, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide. For this reason, we investigated the effect of inert gas on the combustion and emission characteristics in a natural gas/diesel dual-fuel engine. The engine was operated with fixed engine speed and load conditions of 2,000 rpm/100 kW. The ratio of inert gas to natural gas was controlled from 0 % to 10 %. The substitution ratio of natural gas to diesel was set to 80%. Diesel injection timing was varied from TDC to 12° CA BTDC. The results showed that the nitrogen oxide and smoke emission were significantly reduced by the addition of the inert gas due to its high heat capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the compliant parts inevitably have geometric variations, they go through deformations caused by their contacts with fixtures and weld guns prior to welding. When they are released after the welding, they spring back, but still exhibit non-ideal geometry, thus resulting in geometric variations of the autobody with poor quality in both function and perception. These geometric variations occurring in the assembly process are greatly influenced by the position of the fixture. In this study, a methodology for determining the optimal locations of the part locators in such assembly process has been developed. It utilizes the method of influence coefficients for an effective tolerance analysis of flexible body assembly, and a genetic algorithm for optimization. In order to illustrate and verify the developed methodology, two sample problems have been solved, namely, a two-plate assembly problem exhibiting only out-of-plane deformations, and a real-world problem of wheel housing assembly involving three-dimensional deformations.

The items to be considered when conducting FMEDA are the base failure rates with regard to HW elements and the distribution-rates of failure mode, as well as determining whether the HW element is safety related or not. If the failure mode of the safety related HW element is likely to violate the safety goal, the single-point/residual/latent fault should be classified according to the type of safety goal violation. In addition, there is also a study on safety mechanisms, which technical means to defend or avoid failure modes for HW elements that could violate the safety goal. The numerical expression of how effective these safety mechanisms can defend the failure mode of an HW element that could violate the safety goal is the diagnostic coverage(DC). The higher the DC, the better the performance of the safety mechanism. It is also very helpful in reaching the quantitative target value for the vehicle E/E system. Therefore, it is very important to estimate the DC for safety mechanisms. Unfortunately, there is not enough useful reference to estimate the DC value. Moreover, the content described in Annex D of ISO 2662-5: 2011 can be misleading. In this paper, we recognized the misconceptions about the “Evaluation of diagnostic coverage” in ISO 26262-5: 2011 Annex D, and examined how to use the safety mechanisms in FEMDA.

The stored liquid hydrogen must be kept at a temperature of about 20 K. Therefore the space between outer jacket and inner tank is mainly used for the thermal insulation. The permanent heat input during the time the vehicle is not used, leads to pressure and temperature increase of the hydrogen fuel. Therefore, this study is focusing on the development of three-dimensional CFD model of liquified hydrogen storage systems in view of boil-off management for controlled evaporation, pressurization in ullage, flow characteristics of liquid and vapor, thermal stratification and evaporation characteristics on the free surface.

The model predictive control algorithm has been used to compute the optimal longitudinal tire forces of rear-left and rear-right wheels based on the linearized error dynamics. The used error dynamic model has been derived from the planar vehicle dynamic model that was represented by longitudinal, lateral, and yaw dynamics. In order to compute the reasonable optimal tire forces, dynamic physical constraints(e.g., tire force limit and change rate limit of tire force) have been applied to the model predictive control algorithm. Based on the computed optimal tire forces of the rear wheels, the torque distribution ratio between the rear-left wheel and rear-right wheel of the vehicle has been computed based on the wheel dynamics. The yaw rate in a steady state has been used as a reference value for improving the driving stability. The use of the proposed model predictive torque vectoring algorithm can bring about not only good torque distribution, but also sound driving stability. For the performance evaluation, simulation studies with the proposed torque vectoring algorithm have been conducted on Matlab/CarSim environment under various driving conditions, such as step steer, double lane change, and high speed avoidance.

The light from the light emitting diode source moves through the pipe by total reflection principle.
Moving light is sent forward by various optic structures which is applied in the cylindrical pipe.

In addition, the swirl coefficient and swirl ratio were assessed and compared via measurement of the conventional impulse swirl meter(ISM) and calculation based on the velocity by particle image velocimetry(PIV) from 1.75B position, which was 1.75 times bore position apart from the cylinder head, to the 6.00B position. In this study, the influence of the axial flow on the flow evaluation was examined from 1.75B position to the 6.00B position in order to check the constant axial velocity assumption. For this purpose, the evaluation was performed under the assumption that the axial velocity is proportional to the tangential velocity, and the results were compared with the previous ones. The results showed that the influence of the axial velocity was larger than the effect of the evaluation center setting. Also, the swirl coefficient increased because the increase in momentum around the cylinder wall was much larger than the decrease of the one around the evaluation center when the axial velocity was considered. Furthermore, the tangential and axial velocity distributions were quite similar, but there was also a backflow by recirculation in the axial direction, thereby distorting the measured values. On the other hand, when the momentum was conserved, the swirl coefficient measured by the ISM changed according to the measurement plane position due to the momentum conversion caused by the flow structure change. In the ISM evaluation before 5B, the effects of the change of the flow structure and the backflow were significant. After 5B, the effect of friction increased because the structural change was reduced by the flow development. Finally, despite the angle of attack variation due to the flow progression, its effect was not observed because the influences of tangential and axial flows were offset against each other, and the evaluation value increased as the structure of the flow gradually turned to the ideal form in the evaluation of the PIV.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of a spare tire with the normal length of mounting bolt, and the combination of linear static analysis and rigid element modeling for the mounting bolt, neither insulation modeling nor strain-life method was enough to predict the durability performance on the rear floor panel. However, the analysis method was not enough to predict the cracks on the floor as the mounting bolt is longer for the installation of the subwoofer speaker, and the spare tire is reverberating more. DFSS was applied in order to find the root cause and solution of the floor panel crack issue. Therefore, nonlinear analysis(e.g., ABAQUS) was introduced to examine the contact between components, such as rear floor, insulator, subwoofer stowage, and spare tire. In addition, the insulators are modeled in detail. The improved analysis showed well-predicted results in z-direction load vibration test and vehicle durability test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the report, fire risk for the ethanol washer is quickly becoming the main concern of many people. Due to the absence of a case that has been pointed as a fire caused by washer fluids, we are unable to find any concrete evidence that will indicate the danger of washer fluids as a pyrogenic substance. However, we could not believe the report because we could not confirm the methods used by the investigators for those cases. Furthermore, we could not ignore the possibility that the investigators had overlooked the flammability of washer fluids because of the lack of studies. Therefore, we designed a series of experiments to re-confirm the flammability of each washer fluid used by the test in the news. We checked the ratio of the ingredients of each washer fluid and tested them for flammability when exposed to flames and sparks. Then, we checked their flammability after changing the state into gas by boiling and exposing them to flames and sparks. As for the application of the results made in the laboratory into real vehicle fire cases, we designed further experiments re-confirming the flammability of washer fluids. Through these series of experiments, we are able to find that all of these washer fluids can easily caught fire via ignition sources. Furthermore, when the gases were touched by ignition sources, such as flames and sparks, a sudden blaze appeared. As a result, we confirmed that the gases made by washer fluids are highly combustible materials. We did find the possibility of vehicle fires owing to car wind shield washer fluids, and we proposed checklists for advanced fire investigation and safety management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And the validity of the theoretical formula was verified through the actual vehicle test. The results of the actual vehicle test in scenario 4 resulted in a maximum error of 0.21 m. The reason is that it is difficult to detect the lane in the curved road, and it is judged that errors occurred due to the occurrence of significant yaw rates.

To sum up the main study results, the WGV vibration properties were rapidly repeated during the operation. The head of the WGV started to be opened from an at least 45 % throttle load through the whole engine rpm, and the engine load conditions of the WGV opening time gradually increased at up to a 75 % throttle load. The maximum duty control rate was kept at 100 % until about 2,000 rpm, and it gradually decreased until 4,000 rpm but sharply increased again in a region of a very high engine speed of WOT. At these engine operating conditions, the engine torque rapidly decreased because of the decrease in volumetric efficiency. These resulted from the increased engine cooling and exhaust gas losses at a high combustion temperature. Wear of the WGV head and housing seat was observed during the WGT engine endurance test. This led to a decrease of the boost pressure, which directly caused a decrease in the power output of the WGT gasoline engine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To solve this problem, SDPF(Selective Catalytic Reduction on Diesel Particulate Filter) was developed in this study by integrating SCR(Selective Catalytic Reduction) and DPF(Diesel Particulate Filter). To develop SDPF, a mixer, a diffuser angle, and a V-W/TiO₂ catalyst were used, among others. To verify the effectiveness of the developed SDPF in addressing the aforementioned problem, its back pressure and PM/NOX reduction efficiency were measured using an engine dynamometer and emission test devices. The measurements showed that the back pressure of SDPF is lower than that of DPF+SCR, and that it satisfies the EURO-5 regulation. Additional catalytic-activity studies and verifications, however, are necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed control strategy is to combine the two controllers based on a kinematic model and a dynamic model by using an interacting multiple model(IMM). The kinematic model and dynamic model, which are the basis of each controller, are applied to the interacting multiple model in order to obtain the probability of each model on the variations of steering angle and speed.

In case of failing the heat-resistance test after designing and producing a headlight, the design process should start all over again, requiring a lot of time and cost. However, when the design is proceeded with the simulation results using a temperature prediction program, the time and cost spent on the production would be reduced. The previous data based program showed large errors. Accordingly, new prediction program based on three heat transfer mechanisms has to be developed, which should be similar to CFD results but fast.

In terms of the impact estimation, the CPTPP is actually a Korea-Japan FTA, and the most sensitive issue in the FTA is the opening of the auto industry market to Japan. Despite these circumstances, previous studies have predicted that the auto industry will be a beneficiary industry when joining the CPTPP. However, the Korean auto industry is opposed to joining the CPTPP. In order to investigate the cause of this discrepancy, this paper examines the problems of previous studies in estimating the impact of joining the CPTPP and found that the preceding study did not consider the industrial characteristics of the auto sector, especially in the context of Japan-Korea trade, and was heavily dependent on the Armington elasticity (structure) in the demand function of the GTAP CGE model. As a result, the domestic auto sector could lower prices and increase exports when joining the CPTPP. This paper attempts to precisely re-estimate the impact of joining the CPTPP on the auto sector in a way that corrects these problems by changing the CGE model and reflecting the major characteristics of the industry, with policy implications for the negotiation of CPTPP accession.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

논문구성/논리: 우선 트럭 운전자의 정확한 소득과 소득을 구성하는 많은 변수를 식별할 필요가 있다. 그 이유는 충분한 수입이 도로화물 물류 시스템을 안정화시키는 근거가 되기 때문이다. 본 연구는 화물운송인의 소득 수준을 정확하게 이해하기 위해 화물 트럭 운전자를 대상으로 설문 조사를 실시하였고, 주로 t-test와 Anova 분석을 사용하여 다양한 계층적 분석을 실시했다.
결과: 화물자동차 운전자들은 노동시간, 매우 높은 노동 강도, 근무환경 등 매우 열악한 상태에 있다. 그러나 이러한 환경에도 불구하고 운전자들의 실제 소득은 매우 낮은 경향을 나타내고 있다. 설문조사를 토대로 실증분석 결과 화물운전자의 순수소득은 월평균 2,362,700원으로 나타났고 얻고자하는 희망순수소득원은 4,018,800원으로 분석되어 화물운전자들의 열악한 소득 실태를 알 수 있었다.

METHODS: Comparisons were made when a (1) rear reflector, (2) rear reflector and line contour, and (3) rear reflector and full contour were installed in a truck using virtual driving simulation. The safety level of each installation method was quantitatively analyzed by selecting the cognitive distance, safe distance maintenance, and deceleration in the case of using stone embankment as an effective safety measure.
RESULTS : When the rear reflector and full contour was installed, the cognitive range was the longest, and the safety distance could be maintained for a relatively long time. In addition, it was possible to stop or avoid a collision when a sudden event occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: The severity of rear-end crash with freight cars is very high at night, mostly because drivers are unaware of the freight car ahead.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the efficiency of the auto parts industry and the change of total productivity over time in order to analyze the potential as a growth engine of the auto parts industry. The main results obtained from the analysisare summarized as follows. First, using the data of 47 publicly traded companies that produce automobile parts included in East China Economic Region, we obtained efficiency and scale profitability from 2011 to 2016. As a result, we found that BCC efficiency of Shenhua Holdings appeared to be 1. The efficiency of the rest of the companies was analyzed by the IRS in terms of the scale effect of all companies, which is the main reason for the inefficiency of resource allocation related to net technological inefficiency. As a result of estimating the economies of scale for the auto parts companies by the 5 major economic regions in China for the total of 6 years (2011-2016), DRS was strong only in eastern and southern economies. In most of the rest of the region, it was expected that profitability would increase through the increase of scale. In addition, as a result of the total productivity change of the auto parts industry by the 5 major economic regions of China over the period of 2011-2016, the economic power of the North China shows a trend of declining total productivity due to the insufficient innovation potential in 2013. Conversely, in the Northeast and East Asian economies, efficiency increases reflecting the impact of learning and knowledge, market competitiveness, cost structure, and facility utilization rate have been increasing since 2013. According tothe above-mentioned analysis results, it is expected that it will help solve the problems of China's auto parts makers and present policy direction. Especially, Chinese auto parts makers are evaluated as having small size, low concentration, and lack of development capability despite the increase in the number of companies. Therefore, it is necessary to convert a large number of automotive parts companies into a small number of competitive global companies through selective support and mergers and acquisitions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,근사모델을 이용한 강건최적설계의 자동차부품 적용 사례,"Robust optimization,Control arm,Ball joint,Kriging","It is common to apply CAE when developing structural automobile parts. In order to predict the structural performance of an automobile part, more accurate simulation is required, which increases the size of the numerical model. In addition, the optimization technique is applied to reduce weight and improve performance. Recently, optimization methods using metamodels such as response surface method, kriging, and neural network have been widely used. In this study, kriging is adopted to predict the structural performance of automobile part. In addition, it is often unreasonable to suggest performance as a deterministic value when predicting structural performance through CAE. In this study, we introduce a robust optimization scheme that considers uncertainties, and apply it to the design of automobile parts. In this study, the robust optimizations for a control arm and a ball joint were performed respectively. The uncertainties in the tolerances and material property were taken into consideration, and the control arm was optimized for the lightweight design. On the contrary, and the optimum design of the ball joint was suggested considering the pull-out strength. As a result, each optimal solution is presented as a distribution rather than a deterministic value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rotor has an impeller on one end and a thrust runner on the other end. The front (impeller side) and rear (thrust side) gas foil journal bearings (GFJBs) are located between the impeller and thrust runner to support the radial loads, and a pair of gas foil thrust bearings are located on both sides of the thrust runner to support the axial loads. The test GFJBs have a partial arc shim foil installed between the top foil and bump strip layers to enhance hydrodynamic pressure generation. During the rotordynamic performance tests, two sets of orthogonally installed eddy-current displacement sensors measure the rotor radial motions at the rotor impeller and thrust ends. A series of speed-up and coast-down tests to 100k rpm demonstrates the dominant synchronous (1X) rotor responses to imbalance masses without noticeable subsynchronous motions, which indicates a rotordynamically stable rotor?GFB system. Finite element analysis of the rotor determines the rotor free-free (bending) natural modes and frequencies well beyond the maximum rotating frequency. The predicted damped natural frequencies and damping ratios of the rotor?GFB system reveal rotordynamic stability over the speeds of interest. The imbalance response predictions show that the predicted critical speeds and rotor amplitudes strongly agree with the test measurements, thus validating the developed rotordynamic model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,가상주행 시뮬레이터를 이용한 직선구간의 주행안전성 확보를 위한 고찰 - 자동차전용도로 중심으로 -,"Accident prevention, Driving simulator, Straight length, Drowsiness, Attention","PURPOSES : In this study, a virtual driving simulator was used to analyze the effects of implementing appropriate highway driving criteria on the attentiveness of motorists on Korean highways. 
METHODS : The study includes three scenarios. Scenario 1 was purposed to investigate the relationships between driver focus, the brain waves associated with drowsiness, and the speed of motorists driving along the straight 5-km section of Saemangeum South-North Road, which is the same as a car-only road. Scenarios 2 and 3 were designed to have shorter straight sections to enable comparison of the occurrence of drowsiness-related brain waves and velocity changes at 3 km and 2 km, respectively. 
RESULTS : Driver focus was found to decrease and result in speeding after driving 2.5 km of the straight section. Past this point, driver focus continued to decrease, and drivers continued to accelerate. However, upon reaching a curved section, driver focus increased according to the linear change; furthermore, drivers showed a tendency to reduce their speed to a value near the speed limit. 
CONCLUSIONS : According to the analysis of highway traffic accidents that occurred between 2013 and 2015, approximately 50% of total traffic accidents are due to speeding, drowsiness, and negligence. Therefore, if appropriately long straight sections, i.e., sections that are not associated with a reduced ability to focus, are calculated and implemented in road planning and operation, it is possible to prevent accidents caused by lack of driver focus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 5-layer clad material is a multilayer clad material having a sacrificial layer between the filler alloy layer for brazing and the core alloy. In particular, we wanted to compare the corrosion resistance characteristics according to the difference in composition of the alloy constituting the sacrificial layer. In this study, the pressure resistance and corrosion resistance assessment were performed which is generally selected for development of intercoolers. And corrosion resistance to acidic environments was evaluated using solutions of the VDA K3.2 standard.

  Fuel reforming is one way to get hydrogen from the internal combustion engine, using hydrocarbon fuel, exhaust gas steam and heat, hydrogen reformation is achieved using species already available in the exhaust gas. However, for steam reforming to be valuable, the catalyst temperature should be above its light off temperature under engine operating condition.
  This study investigates how the combustion characteristics are affected by the addition of reformed hydrogen in the presence of EGR on a 4 cylinder turbo gasoline direct injection (TGDI) engine.
  It is in the current research that the combustion speed is increased when hydrogen from on-board fuel reforming system is supplied into combustion chamber by means of EGR gas.

In order to cope with increasing exhaust gas regulations, it is required to improve or develop various technologies such as supercharger application, light weight of vehicles, installation of aftertreatment device, downsizing of engine, And the like. Recently, gasoline vehicles have been adopting a CVVT (Continuously Variable Valve Timing) system that freely adjusts valve opening and closing times and periods according to the rotation range of the engine. The CVVT optimizes the valve timing in all operating ranges to improve output and torque and adjust valve overlap to reduce NOx and HC emissions, which are hazardous emissions, using internal EGR.
  Since the CVVT system is operated by oil, a device that can control the oil is needed. Its component is the oil control valve (OCV). The OCV adjusts the valve overlap by adjusting the opening and closing timing and duration of the valve by sending and exhausting engine oil to the crankcase and advance chamber of the CVVT system.
  In this paper, to evaluate the characteristics of OCV (Oil Control Valve), which is a core part of CVVT system, the response test and the stability test of valve according to the temperature and viscosity of engine oil were carried out in motoring engine condition.
  Test results show that the valve response is lower when the oil temperature is lower than when the temperature is higher. The lower the viscosity of the engine oil at lower temperatures, the better the response.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, weight and efficiency of the oil pump have become a key development trend. Of course, these changes are likely to be exposed to a flow cavitation due to rapid pressure changes in the transmission, so that a suitable catalyst bubble inhibitor must be introduced into the hydraulic oil.

An error angle between the d axis of the stationary coordinate system and an axis of the rotating coordinate system occurs due to the position error of the rotor. Therefore, it is necessary to correct the position of the rotor according to the speed of the motor.

Electricity generated from renewable energy must increase to meet the increasing demand for electricity worldwide and to prepare for declining fossil fuels. It is also one of the renewable energy to use liquefied and gasified anthracite that has low utilization, which is not a gasification technology for the existing biomass. Furthermore, when unutilized Off-gas, which is discharged during the process of gasification and manufacturing coal-to-liquid(CTL) through FT(Fischer & Tropsch) reaction for unused coal, is used as the power generation fuel, Energy loss can be reduced and the economical efficiency can be further increased. In this study, we developed an engine that can utilize this low-calorie Off-gas, and studied the characteristics of an engine for a generator that produced electricity with high efficiency and low exhaust gas. A commercial diesel engine was converted to an spark ignition engine and a simulated gas was used as the Off-gas. The engine load was based on IMEP (Indicated Mean Effective Pressure) 3 bar and WOT (Wide Open Throttle) condition, the air-fuel ratio was from the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio to the lean limit, and the ignition timing of all conditions was MBT(Maximum Brake Torque). Through experiments, the fuel flow rate, output, efficiency, and variability of simulated gas, temperature, pressure data and exhaust gas were measured. Using simulated gas, the output of IMEP 3 bar and the maximum thermal efficiency 37% were achieved under the lean burn of WOT condition.

Furthermore, as the perspective effect has different properties along the vertical and horizontal axes of the image, the fixed threshold in bird’s-eye-view coordinate system also has a much lower performance than human operator case.

As the total performance of the vehicle is increased, making high performance of the vehicle dynamics is also important as well as making high performance of the engine to satisfy the customer’s demand. The essential precondition for matching with this customer’s demand is directly connected to reliable brake performance with high performance of chassis systems. For this reason, many automobile manufacturer are trying to compensate the hardware-wise limitation and secure the strong performance of brake systems by using value added functions of ESC.
  Brake Prefill function is one of value added functions of ESC, it detects driver’s brake pedal input in advance and adds the decided brake pressure at each brake corner module prior to the driver’s actual brake input so the function can compensate of brake response time at emergency braking situation. Reduction of brake response time means the function can decrease vehicle collision probability by driver’s brake input delay at emergency braking situation so the function is very meaningful for enhancement of vehicle stability performance and it becomes more effective at high speed braking in particular. But if the function adds excessive brake pressure to bring brake response time into focus, then customers can complain the different brake pedal feeling while Brake Prefill function activates. For this reason, the balance between brake response time and brake pedal feeling is essential factor for the function implementation of Brake Prefill.

In this method, the driver’s manual torque is directly connected to the vehicle’s wheel based on the reliability of the structural connection of the mechanical device. However, in order to implement the active steering technology in the future, SBW is necessary. With the development of various sensors, the new steering technology of the vehicle has developed into the active steering technology of the vehicle by using the sensor for processing software of the recognition information, and the decision subject of the steering has been moved from the person to the ECU. Therefore, Unnecessary time of driver’s operating has increased and the steering column will be a device that measures the steering angle and provides a reaction to the driver in some situations where driver intervention is required. In the present situation that the driver has to intervene in a certain level of steering prior to the fully autonomous driving, in order to make the driver feel the current level of steering feeling for the products driven by the communication using the wire, not only securing the performance of the actuator, A reaction force column device capable of generating a steering feel of the steering wheel by the driving condition is required. In the case of the reaction force device, the motor torque is varied for each vehicle speed only for the purpose of assisting the driver. At this time, the column torque (Nm) sensed by the driver is measured, and this torque will be the reaction force in SBW. The reaction torque of SBW can be variously designed according to the type of reducer and conditions of use.
  In this study, the SBW reaction system using the torque sensor is designed to provide the steering feeling to the driver by using the EPS logic which is used in the past.

Among the many discussions, there is an opinion that the driver’s intervention is required in the transition phase of autonomous driving, or the steering wheel is required for the driver who enjoys manual driving. In this case, the steering device is configured by SBW(Steering By Wire) to allow the steering wheel to be accommodated, thereby enabling both autonomous driving and manual driving. The SBW system consists of a reaction force that can make the driver’s steering feel and an actuator that enables steering. Then connect the two devices by wire (CAN). This helps reduce discomfort during driver steering. By replacing wires with Universal joints with wires, the steering and reaction devices can be accommodated. The reaction device allows the driver to feel the steering depending on the driving environment. In this study, the reaction force device was designed with redundancy. Even when the car breaks down, it minimizes the sense of heterogeneity and enables the car to run. Redundancy systems improve performance and fail / safe, but also increase the size and cost of the ECU. In order to improve fuel economy and optimize cost of vehicles, the reaction force ECU also needs to be miniaturized and optimized. In order to satisfy this problem, the miniaturized FET is applied to ECU. As a result, package optimization was possible by reducing the 2-board multilayer PCB of the existing ECU to 1 board PCB. In addition, production processes and costs can be significantly reduced, resulting in cost competitiveness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then the ECU control abnormal engine combustion with control of ignition timing and etc. A generally used knock sensor is an accelerometer that detects cylinder block surface vibration and estimate the engine knock. The position of knock sensor is selected by measurement of knock signal at many cylinder block surfaces through trial and error. But engine cylinder block has many structural resonances. So the knock sensor signals don’t show reliable results because of the complex of engine combustion knock and cylinder block surface vibration.

Due to the miniaturization, strength degradation may occur. High keratosis of the joints can lead to problems of functional problem strength degradation. In this study, we discuss the articulation (functional) problems of constant velocity joints that can be caused by high keratinization. We have applied a design concept called angle offset to implement a high-angle joint. The angle offset can compensate for the strength by ensuring sufficient groove depth even under high angled conditions. However, there is a disadvantage in that machining is difficult and it is not easy to match the exact dimensions. As a result, a high friction force between the initial ball and the groove is generated, thereby causing a high bending resistance. High friction forces reduce the efficiency of the joint and can be a source of durability problems. In this study, the design factors affecting the bending resistance are derived and the sensitivity is analyzed to derive the factors that can minimize the bending resistance. The optimization technique uses DOE and the strength analysis will also confirm the strength robustness of the model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The control system of the Full Redundancy MDPS can produce a normal 100% output with a double designed motor each output 50%. If one of the dual designed control systems fails, it can generate 50% of the output, so the MDPS system can maintain the steering force even in case of failure. In this paper, we describe the redundant design of parts such as torque sensor, motor position sensor, motor winding and ECU for the development of Full Redundancy MDPS of autonomous vehicle that maintains the steering force even in case of failure. In addition to the performance in the single condition, we have applied the system through the actual vehicle and evaluated it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hydrogen energy is free from pollution and can be used in various fields such as homes, construction, and vehicles. However, due to the very low density per unit volume, it is expensive to store and transport. Liquefaction of hydrogen increases storage and transport efficiency, but it is in the early stage of commercialization due to limitations in technology. Therefore, most of the domestic hydrogen is compressed and stored in the gaseous state and stored and transported to the hydrogen charging station through a pipe or tube trailer. Most of the hydrogen stations in Korea are operated by off-site tube trailers, and most of the stations that are planned for construction will use the tube trailer storage and transfer format. The tube trailer carries a cartridge consisting of a hydrogen storage container (Bundle) and a skid holding the hydrogen container on a trailer and transports it to a hydrogen charging station. Since hydrogen tube trailers carry compressed hydrogen, it is important to ensure stability during transportation.
  In this paper, we designed the hydrogen skid that is applied to the loading / unloading system that can load the cartridge into the trailer in the form of arm roll. There are no domestic and international testing standards for design requirements and evaluation of skids.

But In the extreme hot ambient or On excessive driving condition, the fuel liquid carries over to the canister through the venting valves and wet the charcoal of canister, the canister can’t work enough to absorb vapors.

2019,Scaling & Superimposing 기법을 활용한 크랭크샤프트 댐퍼 허브의 내구성 평가에 관한 해석적 연구,"Torsional Vibration Damper (비틀림 진동 감쇠기),Scaling &amp, Superimposing (크기조정&amp,중첩),Durability (내구성),Crankshaft (크랭크샤프트)","This paper introduces the process of evaluating the durability of the hub of a torsional vibration damper (TVD) using “Scaling & Superimposing” method. TVD is an essential part used to absorb the torsional vibration resonance energy of the crankshaft and to reduce the torsional vibration magnitude when the engine is running. Such TVDs generally consist of a hub, an inertia ring, and an elastomer. The hub is bolted to the front end of the crankshaft and subjected to a combination of static and dynamic loads. If they exceed the material limit of the hub, the hub breaks, leading to failure of the crankshaft. Therefore, the TVD hub must be designed faithfully for the purpose of reducing the torsional vibration of the crankshaft and must also have sufficient resistance for the safety of the crankshaft. The Scaling & Superimposing method used in this analysis can be divided into two areas: stress analysis by a static load and stress analysis by a dynamic load. In this case, the static load refers to the interference between the hub and the crankshaft nose that is generally applied when assembling the TVD and the tightening load of the TVD bolt. And in order to analyze the stress due to the dynamic behavior of the crankshaft, it is necessary to grasp the crankshaft displacement information first. This can be obtained through cranktrain dynamic analysis, which consists of displacement information for each angle during the crankshaft rotation period (typically 720 degrees for 4 cycle IC engine) and then the stress analysis under dynamic behavior can be performed. However, because it requires too much analysis resources, the scaling technique is used for more efficient and simpler analysis. After the two kinds of stress analyses were completed, the results were superimposed to calculate the final mean stress and amplitude stress on the hub. By comparing this with material strength of TVD hub, a safety factor for durability evaluation was generated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A reduction adapter is composed of planetary gear of which reduction ratio is designed with 1.7 (input: ring gear, output: carrier), number of planetary gears. When the reduction gear adapter is applied to the forklift, the engine speed in the idling and low speed ranges cannot meet the performance requirements of the forklift because the engine speed is lowered. Therefore, there is a need for a converter capable of increasing the engine speed in the idling and low speed regions. For this purpose, an embedded system is designed and installed between the acceleration pedal and the transmission of the forklift truck to increase the speed of the accelerator pedal by increasing the signal of the accelerator pedal in the low speed region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During passing by each other in the tunnel, complex pressure wave interactions within the tunnel occur due to the pressure waves by the opposite train.

In order to run this deep neural network-based algorithm in real-time, a Nvidia Jetson TX2 is employed as a single board computer in the TurtleBot3. While training the network in the YOLO, we suffer from much lower recall levels in distinguishing between left-turn and right-turn signs than others. It turns out that this stems from horizontal flipping, one of the built-in means to augment data in the YOLO.

Efficient power transfer requires fast shifting, and accurate slip control is necessary to improve the driver""s ride comfort. In order to improve the slip control performance, it is very important to know the clutch torque. A clutch torque can be known from the clutch disk pressure and torque friction coefficient. The pressure applied to the clutch disk can be measured from the motor current and the force sensor. However, the torque friction coefficient cannot be measured by the sensor. Also, the friction coefficient is unknown because it changes with temperature, slip speed, and pressure on the clutch disk. Therefore, clutch torque estimation with the indirect method has been actively studied. In the forward-direction clutch torque estimation through the engine torque, the exact clutch torque cannot be estimated because the engine torque is inaccurate. Also, the backward-direction clutch torque estimation method using the compliance model has a disadvantage in that the clutch torque cannot be estimated when there is a backlash of the gear. Thus, in this manuscript, we propose a clutch disk torque friction coefficient estimation with a ball-ramp self-energizing mechanism. In the self-energizing mechanism in which the torque caused by friction reinforces the normal force, the gain of the actuator force to the clutch normal force varies according to the friction coefficient. Apply the actuator""s position and force to the model to obtain the change in gain and estimate the clutch disc torque friction coefficient. he ball-ramp actuator is modeled for the torque friction coefficient estimation, and the test bench experiment verifies the clutch torque estimation performance during shifting. Finally, verification of the proposed model and estimation of the clutch disc torque friction coefficient during shifting are conducted via test bench experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the main material of the engine mount consists of rubber with excellent vibration insulation. However, the behaviour of the P/train needs to be controlled in accordance with the demand for high speed driving and continuous vibration performance improvement, so the fluid system was applied. A fluid system consisting of orifice tubes will have damping performance at specific frequencies, controlling the behaviour of P/Train. However, the application of fluid mounts has the disadvantage of having high frequency dynamic characteristics disadvantage due to fluid, a non-compressive material inside rubber. As the high frequency dynamic characteristics increase, the mass damper lamp of more than 1 kg is continuously applied at each stage of development of the vehicle due to the deterioration of the combustion sound and acceleration transmission sound of the diesel engine. Mass dampers play a role of improving vibration sensitivity, but are very unfavorable structures in terms of cost and weight.
Thus, in this paper, the reverse-phase mount structure, which can improve high frequency dynamic properties while maintaining fluid mounts, has been applied. It was also proposed to remove volume-stiffness (resistance to fluid non-compression) by physically separating the rubber and fluid systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CCU is capable of connecting the vehicle""s internal and external networks using modems as well as the internal network. Therefore, vehicle to everything (V2X), over the air (OTA) and vehicle remote control functions can also be fused. The difficulty of system evaluation also increases because the functions of CCU become more complex.

If only certain signal values are monitored, it is easy to know whether they are normal or not. However, it is difficult to intuitively check whether the output values are normal when the entire input changes at the same time.

Therefore, many automobile manufacturers are trying to satisfy the vehicle safety and convenience requirements of consumers by assuring the performance of driving and braking by applying various VAF (Value Added Function) to their vehicles. Thus, VAF is closely connected with the consumer’s vehicle use so it is important not only to implement the function but also to ensure the reliability and stability in the function operation.
  HSA(Hill Start Assist) is a kind of VAF, which means that if the driver has to release the brake pedal to prepare for departure on a sloping hill, the vehicle will necessarily be pushed to a lower slope. In this situation, the undesired movement of the vehicle gives the driver a psychological and physical risk situation. While the driver is preparing to launch the vehicle, HAS controls the brake system to stop the vehicle for a certain period of time so the function helps driver to launch the vehicle easily. When HSA is activated, ESC(Electronic Stability Control) system maintains the brake pressure on each wheel for a certain period of time through the inner valve control in HCU(Hydraulic Control Unit) and the vehicle can be stopped without being pushed from the hill even when the driver releases the brake pedal.
  As mentioned above, HSA controls the brake system directly so performance and noise occurrence of the function are determined according to the configuration of the brake system. In this paper, HSA noise is focused when HSA is activated and we analyze the cause that there is the deviation of noise level despite two vehicles of same model use same HSA algorithm and the brake system then we suggest the solution for reducing the noise level deviation.

However, if the number of valve operating counts progressively increases or the total resistance force is larger than the magnetic force due to the additional reaction force such as sticky forces environmentally generated , the valve may not be operated normally even when the power is applied, so that the closed stuck can be caused. Therefore, the PCSV requires careful consideration of the possibility of valve closed stuck and a robust design for the closed stuck. In this study, we discuss how to improve the valve closed stuck, which can be caused by external environment or repetitive valve operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, the rigidity and machining accuracy of the main housing affect system performance. In particular, the C-EPS with the low-rigidity main housing may degrade the NVH performance and system efficiency because the main housing is slightly deformed due to the reducer component generated when the motor operates at the maximum output. Thus, the main housings that are currently in production are heavily weighted to increase rigidity.

Environmentfriendly technologies for environment-related regulations such as reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency, and technology for driving convenience using electric steering control systems, and safety technology to protect drivers, passengers, nearby vehicles and pedestrians. Large commercial vehicles require a high-power steering system that used engine-driven hydraulic pump systems (genally used min 120bar, 17Liter/min) compared to passenger cars. In recent technical trend, In order to improve fuel efficiency and realize autonomous driving technology, we designed EHPS and Motor driven electric control actuator with the same structure as C-EPS.
  Unlike the HPS system, the power used in the EHPS system is the motor, which rotates the gear pump to generate flow and pressure, and the steering oil is delivered to the ball nut gearbox to operate the power steering system through the pitman arm. The advantage of EHPS is that it does not use the engine drive torque, so it improves fuel efficiency by about 1%, and when the pump is connected in parallel, it can secure the flow rate to the main steering. In this process, it is difficult to realize the active autonomous driving technology of the vehicle itself through the steering angle control separately from the driver""s steering intention. Therefore, the motor control device directly connected to the steering wheel is essential, and we can design the actuator system by selecting the package and the required output according to the use conditions. The required steering torque as a general auxiliary steering was about 20 Nm, and the C-EPS type actuator using a worm reducer was manufactured and the performance evaluation was carried out.

Normally, this methods use precise map including information of various landmarks. Among the various landmarks, lane is very useful for vehicle localization. So we implemented a monocular camera-based lane-end-point detection before. Our algorithm detects the candidate point of lane-end-point in the region of 4-19m in the longitudinal direction from the camera. After then, the bird’s-eye view image is created to apply HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradient)-SVM(Support Vector Machine). This bird’s-eye view image requires a rectangular area of 1m×2m. Because of this area, the minimum longitudinal distance where lane-end-points can be detected is limited to 6m. So the candidate points in the region of 4-6m can’t be verified. To address this problem, this paper proposes a tracking method of lane-end-point based on wheel speed sensor. Through the proposed method, we can verify the lane-end-point based on reliability of tracking without HOG-SVM. As a result, the proposed method detects 13.5% more lane-end-points than the existing method and also shows almost the same recognition rate as that of existing method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NASS-CDS has a lot of detailed accident data in real fields, but there is no data of accurate velocity in accident moments. So in order to propose scenario generation method from accident database, we try to reconstruct accident moment from accident sketch diagram. At the same step, we propose an accident of occurrence frequency which is based on accident codes and road shapes.

Especially if torsional vibration damper which is one of the key components connecting driving system of engine and driveline fails and then the construction equipment itself does not work, it takes a lot of cost and time to identify the cause of the failure and prepare an improvement plan. In this study, the calculation model which is multi-body dynamic one is developed to analyze torsional vibration on the driving axis system of the construction equipment including both driving system of engine and driveline. Furthermore, design engineers who are not familiar with CAE tool can easily create their calculation model for torsional vibration analysis and perform it based on EXCEL template without complex CAE knowledge. Also, robust optimal design method with the developed calculation model is used to improve torsional vibration on the development process of construction equipment considering worst condition such as misfiring of engine and various gear ratio of transmission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,제4차 산업혁명 시대의 자율주행자동차 상용화를 위한 안정적 법적 기반을 위한 법정책적 연구 = 자율주행자동차 특별법 제정(안)을 중심으로,"자율주행자동차,법적쟁점,정책이슈,특별법,입법안,Self-driving cars,Legal issues,Policy issues,Special laws,Legislation","2016년 다보스포럼에서 클라우드 슈밥이 언급한 ?제4차 산업혁명?은 우리의 삶을 획기적으로 바꾸고 있으며, 그 정점에 자율주행자동차가 이 시대의 화두로 떠오르고 있다. 그러나 우리나라에서 자율주행자동차가 성공적으로 도입 및 정착되기까지는 아직 극복해야 할 과제들이 많이 있다. 특히 ?인간? 중심의 법제도를 ?인공지능?이 포함된 법제도로 패러다임을 변화해야 할 것이다. 자율주행자동차 시대의 안정적 운용을 위해서는 사람중심의 입법체계에 대한 획기적인 변화가 필요하다. 즉, 자율주행자동차를 운행하는 운행주체가 누구인지(무엇인지)와 일반도로에서 일반 자동차와 운행이 가능한지 여부, 교통사고 발생 시 민형사상 책임 문제, 자율주행자동차 관련 보험 문제, 개인정보수집과 이용에 관한 문제, 제3자에 의한 오남용 문제 등을 종합적이고 포괄적으로 검토해야 한다. 본 연구에서는 도로교통 관련 국내 법률, 해외 법제현황, 자율주행자동차 관련 법적 쟁점 등을 검토하여 입법론적 관점에서 자율주행자동차 운행 시 발생하는 제반 법적 문제 해결을 위한 별도의 법안 신설을 제안하며 그 법안에 대한 내용을 제시하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,자율주행자동차와 제조물 책임에 관한 연구 - 최근 자동차관리법 일부 개정에 즈음하여 - = A study on Self-driving Cars and the Product Liability Act ?Focusing on the Recent Revision of the Automobile Management Act-,"The Product Liability Act,self-driving cars,self-driving system,the Automobile Management Act,design defects,warning defects.,제조물책임,자율주행자동차,자율주행시스템,설계상의 결함,표시상의결함,자동차관리법","본고에서는 자율주행자동차 사고의 경우 제조물책임법의 실효성을 보장하기 위한 방안을 마련하기 위하여 동법상의 결함의 유형과 문제점 등을살펴보고, 이와 관련하여 자동차관리법, 자동차규칙, 부분 자율주행시스템의 안전기준 및 자동차관리법 일부 개정안 등을 검토하면서 자율주행자동차의 결함에 대한 자동차제작자의 책임 추궁을 위한 제도적 보완의 필요성과 몇 가지 대안을 제시하였다.
첫째, 자율주행자동차 사고의 경우에는 제조물책임법상의 “결함추정” 규정만으로는 피해자가 동 자동차의 결함을 입증하는 데는 한계가 있으므로아예 입증책임을 전환하여 자동차제작자가 자율주행시스템 상에 결함이없었다는 점을 입증하도록 함으로써 자동차제작자의 책임을 강화할 필요가 있다고 보았다. 동 자동차의 결함은 대부분이 자율주행시스템의 오작동에 의하여 발생하고, 특별한 사정이 없는 한 자동차제작자의 실질적 지배영역에 있다는 점을 고려하면 이것이 특히 동 자동차제작자에게 불합리하다고 볼 수 없을 것이다. 둘째, 자동차관리법 제31조 제1항은 자동차 및자동차부품에 결함이 있는 경우에 시정조치를 하도록 규정하고 있으나 자율주행자동차의 자율주행시스템에 대한 업데이트는 동 시스템의 결함여부와 상관없이 지속적으로 이루어져야 할 것이므로 이를 의무화할 필요가있다고 보았다. 자율주행시스템은 기계학습(machine learning)을 의하여새로운 운행환경에 대한 데이터를 추가적으로 학습함으로써 자동차를 안전하게 운행하도록 설계되어 있으므로 동 시스템의 성능개선과 안전성 확보를 위하여 지속적인 업데이트가 필수적으로 요구되기 때문이다. 셋째, 제조물의 결함을 입증하기 위한 자료가 대부분 제조업자의 수중에 있다는점을 고려하면 제조업자나 제조업자를 위하여 문서를 소지하고 있는 자는원고 측의 문서제출요구를 정당한 이유 없이 거절하지 못하도록 할 필요가 있다고 보았다. 자동차관리법 일부 개정안은 원고와 법원에게 자동차의성능시험대행자에 대한 정보제출요구권을 인정하고 있으나 아예 제조물책임법에 문서제출명령의 실효성 확보를 위한 규정을 도입하는 것이 바람직하다고 할 것이다. 넷째, 자율주행시스템의 결함을 조사하기 위한 전문조사기관의 설립할 필요성이 있다고 보았다. 자율주행시스템의 소프트웨어는 기계학습과 딥러닝 기술에 의하여 자동차를 최적 상태로 운행하기 위한 값을 도출하므로 동 분야의 고도의 지식을 가진 전문가가 아닌 한, 동시스템의 결함여부를 밝혀내는 것이 거의 불가능하기 때문이다. 다섯 째, 자율주행자동차 사고에 대하여 제조물책임범의 적용 가능성에 대하여 논란이 되는 이유가 동 자동차 사고의 원인을 밝히는 것이 쉽지 않다는 데있다는 점을 고려하면 동 자동차 사고 전후의 기록은 동 자동차 사고의원인을 밝히는 데에 중요한 자료가 될 수 있으므로 자율주행자동차의 경우에는 “사고기록장치”의 장착을 의무화할 필요가 있다고 보았다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

원칙적으로는 시스템이 주행하지만 돌발 상황에서 인간 운전자의 개입이 요구되는 레벨 3 자율주행자동차부터 도로에 등장할 것이다. 하지만 꽤 오랜 기간 동안 인간이 운전하는 자동차와 레벨 3 자율주행자동차가 도로를 함께 달리게 될 것이고, 당분간 레벨 3 자율주행자동차가 전체 차량에서 차지하는 비중은 크지 않을 것으로 예상된다. 따라서 단계적으로 법제를 바꾸어나가는 것이 바람직하다고 본다. 아직까지는 자율주행자동차에 대한 이해와 경험이 부족하기 때문에 제조물 책임 법제를 포함한 불법행위체계와 보험 법제를 급진적으로 바꾸는 것은 비용이 많이 들고 전체적인 방향설정이 잘못될 우려가 있다.
따라서 당분간은 자율주행모드에서 사고가 발생한 경우, 시스템 오작동에 차량소유자의 과실이 없다면 그의 손해배상책임을 면제해주는 한편 피해자 보호를 위해 자동차 보험자에게 보험금지급의무를 부과하되, 보험자는 시스템 오작동에 귀책 있는 자에게 구상을 할 수 있도록 하는 것이 바람직하다. 시스템 오작동의 원인이 다양한 만큼, 원인을 세부적으로 나누어서 소유자, 보험자, 제조사, 해커 등에게 책임을 배분함이 타당하다. 한편, 수동주행모드에서 발생한 사고에 대해서는 현행 자동차손해배상보장법제와 보험법제를 적용하면 될 것이다.
그러나 레벨 3 자율주행자동차가 전체 자동차 중에서 차지하는 비중이 50%를 넘어가거나 레벨 4 자율주행자동차의 보급률이 높아지는 시기가 되면 제조물책임법제와 보험법제의 전반적인 변혁이 불가피할 것이다. 이에 대비해서 자율주행자동차의 기술 발전과 시장 상황 변화를 잘 따라가면서 공평 타당하며 비용 효율적인 법제를 끊임없이 모색할 것을 제안한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

자동차의 결함으로부터 국민의 생명과 신체를 보호하기 위해 자동차관리법 제31조 제1항은 이른바 자동차 리콜제도를 도입하였다. 그리고 제31조 제1항을 위반하면 제78조 제1호에 따라 형사처벌을 할 수 있다.
현행법에 의하면 자동차 또는 자동차 부품이 자동차안전기준 및 부품안전기준에 부합하지 않거나 안전운행에 지장을 주는 등의 결함이 있는 경우, 자동차 제작자 등은 자발적으로 리콜을 해야 한다. 자동차 리콜과 관련된 형사처벌은 사전에 자동차관리청의 시정명령을 전제로 하는 것을 원칙으로 하고, 자발적 리콜의 경우에도 자동차 제작자 등의 책임이 명백한 경우로 한정해야 한다. 현행법상 자발적 리콜의 대상인 결함 가운데 ‘안전운행에 지장을 주는 등의 결함’은 그 요건의 불명확성으로 인해 법적 안정성과 예측가능성을 훼손할 수 있다.
자동차 제작자 등이 안전운행에 지장을 주는 등의 결함사실을 알았으나 그 원인 파악과 적절한 시정조치에 상당한 시간이 소요되거나 불가능하여, 지체없이 시정하지 아니한 경우에도 처벌받는 경우 또는 입법목적 달성을 위해 ‘결함사실을 안다’는 의미를 ‘자동차 제작자 등이 결함사실의 추상적 가능성을 인정하는 것’까지를 포함하는 경우 등은 자동차 제작자 등에게 귀책사유가 없는 경우에도 형사처벌을 하는 것으로 책임주의원칙에 위배될 수 있다.
한편, 자기인증제도는 강력한 행정력에 의해 뒷받침되어야 한다. 자동차관리청이 체계적인 정보관리를 통해 자동차 또는 자동차부품의 안전기준 적합성 및 안전성을 검증하고, 제작결함이 발견된 경우 적절한 시정을 확보할 수 있는 시스템이 갖추어져야 한다. 자동차의 안전사고 신고제를 도입하여 자동차관리청의 효율적인 감독체계를 구축한 다음, 자동차 제작자 등의 부정한 신고와 시정명령 위반에 대해 형사처벌을 해야 한다. 이로써, 소비자의 생명, 신체 또는 재산에 대한 위해를 발생 또는 발생시킬 우려가 있는 자동차에 대해 신속한 제작결함 발견과 적절한 시정조치가 이루어질 수 있도록 하고, 국민의 안전과 소비자의 보호에 소홀함이 없도록 해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

시스템연구에 있어서는 자동차보조시스템 핵심부품기술연구개발능력을 확대해야 하는데 고밀도압축파이프, 수소밸브, 가습기, DC-DC 변환기 등의 핵심부품기술이 더욱 더 개선되어야 한다. 이러한 핵심부품기술이 확보되어야만 수소연료전지배터리, 핵심부품, 발전기시스템 등의 측정기술과 표준체제 연구가 전개될 수 있다. 또한 배터리연구에 있어서는 핵심재료 및 부품의 기초연구가 강화되어야 하며 수소연료전지배터리의 핵심기술 공정을 확립해야 한다.  양성자 교환막체계, 촉매제, 탄소질, 공기압축기인 컴프레서, 수소분사펌프 등 핵심기술 연구를 지속하여 배터리제품의 성능과 수명을 향상시키고 비용을 절감해야 한다. 또 수소에너지가 풍부한 지역을 중심으로 수소에너지의 체계적인 응용 및 연료전지자동차의 시범운영을 법률로 제정함으로써 합법적인 근거를 확립해야 한다. 수소연료전지산업의 표준과 관련해서는 몇몇 국가기관이 중복된 감독을 실시하고 있기 때문에 시정될 필요가 있다. 즉 감독을 일원화해야 하며, 보다 과학적이고 합리적인 표준을 제정함으로써 부처 간에 유기적인 협력이 구축되도록 해야 한다.
수소연료전지자동차산업에 대한 정부의 보조금정책은 수소연료전지자동차산업 생태계에 미치는 영향력을 최대한 확대해야만 한다. 수소연료전지자동차 보조대상과 기준, 요건 등 실체법에 대해서는 이것이 시장경제요건 하에서 정부의 산업발전의 객관적인 규율에 부합하는가의 문제가 있고, 실무과정에서 출현하는 제품판매 데이터는 기업의 신고와 실제사용 간에 차이가 존재하는 통계상의 오류라는 문제가 존재하며, 수소연료전지자동차회사의 법적 책임과 관련하여 수소연료전지자동차회사가 기만을 구성하는 특수성문제 및 사기와 보조금규칙간의 연계문제는 아직 뚜렷하게 해결된 바가 없다. 또한 보조대상, 보조기준 및 요건 등 규칙의 제정과 관련하여 절차에 있어서도 투명성이 부족하다. 예로 사전검증이 부족하고 사업자단체와 기업, 일반국민의 의견청취가 충분하지 않는 경우도 존재한다.
그리고 보조금이 실질적으로 큰 효과가 없거나 보조금 조정방법이나 지급시기 등의 절차가 합리적이지 않아 중국국민의 공감이 형성되기 어려운 경우 어떻게 해결해야 하는가라는 문제에 대해 현재로서는 법률규정이 분명하지 않다. 수소가스충전소 건설과 관리가 급속도로 성장하는 수소연료전지자동차 판매수요를 따라가지 못하고 있다. 수소가스충전소가   ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(연구방법) 본 연구에서는 소비자의 트랜드에 대한 특성 분석을 위하여 2010년부터 국내자동차 시장에서 판매가 가장 많은 차종과 시트 종류를 연구대상으로 하고 한국자동차산업협회의 소비자 자동차 트랜드를 조사, 분석하여 최근에 양산 및 판매되는 자동차 4사의 24종 시트를 선별하여 설문 및 통계연구를 진행하였다. 설문 및 분석 내용은 시트디자인에 있어 접근성에, 가시성, 용이성, 인지성, 안전성, 심리성에 대하여 세부적으로 설문하고 분석하였으며, 설문자료를 기반으로 통계 연구를 실시하여 각 항목 및 내용별로 유의성을 도출하여 내용을 분석, 종합하였다. (결과) 시트디자인의 접근성에 있어서는 자동차 실내의 다른 요소가 물리적 부담에 영향을 미치며, 사용 시 어깨 부위 및 옆 라인의 경사에 대한 디자인적 고려가 필요하며, 가시성에 있어서는 시트의 조작 여부가 정보적 시각기능에 영향을 미치므로 디자인 시 고려할 사항이며, 기능적 시각 반응은 형태와 컬러가 시각 반응에 많은 영향을 미치는 결과를 분석할 수 있었다. 또한 인지성에 있어서는 컬러에 대한 시각 반응은 시트의 조작과 결부되며 패턴 및 엠보와 같은 재질이 조작 및 작동에 촉각적으로 인지 반응이 높고 안전성에 있어서는 편안함이 높을수록 안전성에 대한 인식이 높고 시각적인 요소가 조작 시 관계성이 높으며, 감성적인 편안함이 높고 촉감 측면의 재질이 만족도에 영향을 미친다는 결과를 얻을 수 있었다. (결론) 향후 시트디자인에 있어서 6항목의 내용이 개발 및 디자인에 체크리스트화 되어 고려사항이 되어야 하겠으며, 자율주행 환경에서는 사용자의 감성적인 측면을 고려하여 향에 의한 후각 및 소리에 의한 청각에 영향을 주는 시트가 개발 및 디자인되고 있어 향후 오감을 통한 인지성의 극대화가 경제성에 많은 영향을 끼칠 것으로 예측된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,자율주행자동차 운행으로 인해 발생한 형사책임의 귀속주체 = The subject of criminal liability caused by driving of automated vehicle,"Automated vehicle,Artificial intelligence,Road Traffic Act,Levels on Automation,Trolley dilemma,자율주행자동차,인공지능,도로교통법,자동화 단계,트롤리 딜레마","자율주행자동차는 운전자의 상시적인 차량 제어가 없어도 스스로 운행하는 자동차를 말한다. 자율성은 0에서 5단계로 구분되고, 4단계부터는 운전자가 차량을 운행할 책임이 완전히 제거된다. 본 논문에서는 자율주행자동차의 운행과 관련하여 형사상 범죄가 발생하였을 때 그 책임귀속 주체에 대하여 논의하여 본다.
먼저 자율주행자동차의 설계자 및 제작자의 책임을 생각해 볼 수 있다. 이들은 자율주행자동차의 판단기준을 제시하였으므로 자율주행자동차가 범죄결과를 발생시킴에 대하여 전체적인 고의가 있다. 그러나 이들이 겪는 딜레마를 고려한다면 이들에게 무제한적으로 형사책임을 묻기 어렵다. 이에 대해 일반조항인 형법 제20조를 적절히 적용?해석하는 것이 요구된다. 한편 설계자?제작자에게 자율주행자동차 하드웨어 및 소프트웨어의 설계?제작에 관한 과실이 있고 그 과실로 인해 범죄결과가 발생하였다면 위 논의와는 별개로 과실범 책임을 질 수 있다.
다음으로 자율주행자동차에 탑승한 사람의 형사책임이 문제된다. 3단계 자율주행자동차의 운전자는 상시적으로 차량을 운전할 필요는 없지만 사고발생상황 등 비상상황에서 차량을 적절히 통제할 의무는 여전히 존재한다. 그러한 의무를 다하지 아니하여 사고가 발생하였다면 형사책임을 면할 수 없다. 이와 달리 4단계 이상의 자율주행자동차의 운전자는 운전에서 완전히 배제되고, 극히 예외적인 경우에만 자율주행자동차 운행으로 인한 형사책임을 질 것이다. 무면허운전 및 음주운전죄도 위와 같은 전제에서 판단하면 될 것으로 보인다.
마지막으로 검토될 것은 자율주행자동차가 스스로 인간과 독립하여 형사책임을 부담할 수 있는가의 문제이다. 아직 이 단계의 논의가 활발하게 이루어질 정도로 자율주행자동차의 인공지능이 발전하지는 아니한 것으로 생각된다. 그러나 미래 기술은 예측할 수 없는 속도와 방향으로 전개될 수 있으며, 어느 시점에서는 인간의 제어를 벗어난 자율주행자동차 자체를 형사처벌하여야 할 필요성이 대두될 수도 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,자율주행자동차에서의 대차료와 수리비에 대한 고찰 = A Study on the Car Leasing Charges and Cost of Car Repairing for Autonomous Vehicle,"자율주행자동차,자동차보험,대차료,수리비,자동차보험 표준약관,렌트카,Autonomous Vehicle,Car Insurance,Car Leasing Charges,Cost of Car Repairing,Standard Terms and Conditions in Car Insurance,Rental Car","자율주행자동차는 제4차 산업혁명의 대표적인 기술 중 하나로 「자동차관리법」제2조 제1호의3에 “운전자나 승객의 조작 없이 스스로 주행이 가능한 자동차”라고 정의되어 있다. 자율주행자동차는 이미 구글, 테슬라 등 외국기업은 물론 현대자동차 등 국내기업에서도 상용화를 위한 연구·개발이 상당부분 진척되었다.
이에 따라 자율주행자동차를 위한 입법 대응은 물론 자율주행자동차를 위한 보험제도정비도 반드시 상용화 이전에 해결되어야 할 것이다. 이러한 인식 속에서 세계 각국 정부와 보험업계는 자율주행자동차 시범운행과 상용화를 대비하여 보험제도에 대한 본격적인 논의에 착수하였고, 상당한 진척을 이루었다. 하지만 자율주행자동차 관련 보험제도 논의에 앞서 기존의 일반자동차 보험에서 논란이 되었던 몇 가지 문제점들에 대해서는 여전히 이해관계가 나뉘고 있는데, 대표적으로 고급수입자동차의 대차료와 수리비 상당의 보험금 지급 문제이다. 자율주행자동차가 기존의 자동차보다 고가로 책정될 것이라는 것은 누구나 쉽게 예상이 가능한데, 고급수입자동차와 관련하여 논란이 되었던 렌트카 대차료와 수리비에 관한 문제는 고가인 자율주행자동차에 관해서도 반복될 여지가 높다고 생각된다.
우리나라 자동차보험 표준약관은 사고 발생 시 대차료에 관하여 “동급의 대여자동차중 최저요금의 대여자동차를 빌리는데 소요되는 통상의 요금”을 지급하도록 규정하고 있는데, 여기서 “동급의”라는 문구를 “배기량, 연식이 비슷한 동급의 대여자동차 중 최저요금의 대여자동차”라고 보충하고 있어 고가의 수입자동차를 동종의 배기량, 연식을 가진국내자동차를 대여하는 비용 상당액을 배상하고 있다. 하지만 자율주행자동차가 사고가배상하는 경우 자율주행자동차 아닌 일반 자동차 대차료를 배상한다면 몇 가지 문제가발생할 수 있어 이에 대한 개선이 필요하다. 수리비에 관하여는 우리나라 자동차보험표준약관에서 “원상회복에 필요 타당한 비용”을 배상하는 것을 원칙으로 하고 있지만 개정을 통하여 “경미한 손상의 경우 복원수리를 기준으로” 배상하고 있다. 자율주행자동차의 경우 첨단센서 등 고가의 주행보조장치들이 탑재되어 있어 경미한 손상의 경우에도기능상 문제가 발생할 수 있고, 반면에 주행보조장치의 경미한 손상에 대하여 전체부품교환비용 상당액을 지급한다면 보험회사에게 재정상 부담을 지을 수 있어 이에 대한 개선이 필요하다.
따라서 본 논문에서는 자율주행자동차 보험제도에 대한 외국의 사례를 검토하고, 舊 자동차보험 표준약관 상 대차료, 수리비용 문제를 통하여 자율주행자동차의 대차료와 수리비용의 문제를 중심으로 자율주행자동차 보험제도의 개선방안을 제시하고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(연구방법) 본 연구에서는 국내 자동차의 소비자의 트랜드 분석에 있어 한국자동차산업협회(KARI)의 자료를 기반으로 하여 2010년 이후 자율주행이 개발되는 시기부터 국내 자동차 시장에서 유통되는 빈도 높은 차종의 IP 디자인을 연구대상으로 하였으며, 국내에서 가장 많은 판매가 되는 자동차 4사의 자동차 판매장에서 24종의 IP 디자인을 대상으로 설문 및 통계연구를 진행하였다. (결과) IP 디자인은 조작성에 있어 계기판의 집중성에 의한 운전자 전망에 대한 편리사항이 중요하다는 결과를 인지할 수 있었으며, 가시성에 있어서는 시각적 활동인 계기판에 대한 판독 및 인식이 빠를수록 만족도가 높다는 결과이며, 따라서 IP를 위하여 다른 영역의 재질이나 컬러 디자인이 매우 중요하다는 결과를 얻을 수 있었다. 또한, 인지성에 있어서는 IP는 시각적으로 연계성이 있는 다른 영역과 유사 및 보색 배색으로 적용되었을 때 기능성과 만족도가 높다는 결과를 분석할 수 있었고, 만족도에서는 시각적인 측면에서 수평적 안정감이 안락함과 디자인 기능에 많은 영향을 미친다는 결과를 도출할 수 있었다. (결론) 이와 같은 연구 결과는 근래 소비자들의 다양한 개성을 요구에 대한 반영된 변화이며, 따라서 향후 미래 자동차의 실내 공간에서는 더욱 다양한 소비자의 감성이 반영된 컬러와 소재로 변화가 필요하다. 이를 위해서는 다양한 소재의 개발과 더불어 소비자들의 감성이 적용된 다양성 있는 공간으로 진화되어야 하며, 자율주행 시 자동차 실내 공간에 대한 감성적 디자인 방향에 있어 더 많은 연구가 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,자율주행자동차 도입의 파급효과와 대응전략 = Impact Analysis of Autonomous Vehicles and Policy Implications,,"This study aims to estimate the socioeconomic effects of autonomous vehicles (AVs hereafter) and to propose AV policy alternatives in Korea. An interview survey was conducted in Seoul Metropolitan Area to see Korean people’s choices and understanding regarding AVs. The survey asked intention of purchase and usage; and mode choice behaviors with the assumption of new mode availability of AV car, AV taxi, and AV shuttle. Based on the survey results the socioeconomic effects are estimated, and policy options are proposed.
  The findings from the survey are summarized as follows. Around 50% of interviewees want to buy or use AVs. Even after AV options added in available modes, they prefer to use privately owned AVs. The shift from car users to AV taxis or AV shuttles is about 20%. The shift from transit users for commute purpose to them is about 13%, which is the higher than the shift from those for other trip purpose. Mid-to-long distance car travel increases by 8% to 13%. Considering increased travel distance of unoccupied shared AVs, traffic and travel distance may increase.
  Based on the survey results and existing study results, the socioeconomic impacts from AVs are estimated. It is likely that traffic congestion in a city center grows higher due to mode choice changes and increased travel distance of unoccupied shared AVs. GHG emission or fuel consumption may increases due to the increased travel distance, but it may decrease due to higher eco-friendly car share and fuel efficiency improvement. As the electric vehicle share increases, the fuel tax revenue decreases. The mode choice changes from the survey imply that the transit mode share decreases with new AV options available. The parking demand decreases as decrease of car ownership and accessibility improvement, making existing parking spaces available for other-than-parking purposes. As AVs replace drivers, the driver labor market shrinks, but AV related new industries provides new jobs.
  This study proposes the following policy directions to promote shared AV mobility in a short term: enhancing car-pool services, providing legal frameworks, facilitating eco-friendly vehicle market penetration, adopting more test beds, and providing dedicated lanes. Also it proposes the following policy alternatives in a mid-to-long term: the integration between shared AV services and transit, mileage based vehicle tax, supporting start-up R&Ds, soft landing AV adoption in driver labor market, transit oriented network building in a city planning stage, effective use of newly available spaces due to parking demand changes, and dedicated spaces for shared AVs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

먼저, 자율주행자동차의 안전을 위한 규제적 측면에서 자율주행자동차에 대한 규제권한의 문제가 제기된다. 미국의 경우 자동차의 설계 및 작동에 관한 규제권한은 연방정부가 가지는 반면 운전면허와 도로에서의 차량운행에 대한 규제권한은 주정부가 가진다. 그런데 자율주행자동차는 차량의 설계에 운행시스템이 유기적으로 결합되어 양자의 통합적 규제가 요구된다는 점에서 새로운 규제시스템 필요하다. 우리 법제 역시 차량의 안전성에 대한 규제와 운전자에 대한 면허제도가 별개로 이루어지고 있는데 이제 여기에 자율주행시스템에 대한 규제를 통합하여야 한다. 또한 자율주행자동차의 안전기준은 실행가능하고 자동차 안전에 필수적이며 객관적 용어로 규정되어야 하는데 이는 자동차 및 자동차 부품의 제조자에 대해 안전성을 달성할 수 있는 특정한 방법을 요구하는 기술기준이 아니라 달성해야 하는 안전성을 요구하는 성과기준을 의미한다. 다음으로 정보의 수집 및 이용과 관련하여 프라이버시권에 대한 침해의 문제가 제기될 수 있으며 이는 (1) 정부가 개인정보에 접근하고 이를 이용하는 문제와 (2) 개인정보를 상업적으로 이용하는 문제로 구분하여 볼 수 있다. 미의회는 자율주행자동차 이용자의 프라이버시 보호를 위한 법안을 마련하기 위해 노력하고 있으나 아직 구체적인 법제적 틀은 마련되지 않고 있다.
우리나라는 현재까지 「자동차관리법」을 중심으로 자율주행자동차의 시험운행이 가능하도록 지원하는 범위에서 규율이 이루어지고 있다. 그러나 이제 자율주행자동차의 상용화에 대비하여 도로 위에서의 운행을 위한 전반적인 규율의 틀이 마련되어야 한다. 이 과정에서 의회와 정부로서는 지속적인 연구와 함께 자동차 업계, 소비자, 학계와의 협력이 필수적으로 요구될 것이다. 우리 사회가 자율주행자동차...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  본 연구에서는 CVT 내의 타음의 가진계로서 플레이트의 높이와 디텐트 스프링의 강성을 조정해 양쪽 부분품이 충돌시에 발생하는 충격량을 저감함으로써 타음 자체의 입력 크기를 줄인다. 전달계로서 조작계 부품 자체의 질량과 지지부의 강성을 조절해 가진계로부터의 충격량의 전달을 완화시켜 결론적으로 운전자가 느끼는 타음레벨을 저감할 수있는 조작계 구조에 대해서 제안한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The front of the vehicle effectively acts as a cushion that slows the time it takes for the vehicle to come to a complete stop, applying less force on passengers, which could help save their lives. For vehicle frontal collision protection, it is then very common to see cars equipped with an energy absorbing crash box, which is attached on Front Side Member (FSM), and the use of advanced polymer composite materials in the crash box has been actively considered in recent years.

  이에 일본 경찰청에서 국회에 제출한 일본도로교통법 개정안은 우리 도로교통법에게 시사점을 안겨준다고 할 수 있다. 다른 법에서도 유사성이 있을 수 있지만 도로교통법의 경우 한국과 일본은 그 입법목적부터 상당한 유사성을 지닌 특성이 있다. 따라서 일본의 개정방향은 우리에게 상당한 검토 자료로서의 역할을 할 수 있다.
  일본 도로교통법 개정의 경우 우선 그 특징을 세 가지로 나누어 볼 수 있다. 첫째, 일본의 경우 자율주행자동차에 대한 개념에 대해서 자동화된 기계로 인식하였다. 따라서 용어 또한 자동운전차라고 하여 기존에 이름만 자동차이지 타동차인 자동차가 좀 더 진전된 자동기술을 보유한 채로 관리주체인 사람의 역할이 필요한 용어로 정리한 것으로 보이며 이에 따라 자율주행장치를 사용하는 것을 인간운전자가 운전하는 행위의 범주에 포함시키고 이에 따른 관리의무 등을 제시하였다. 둘째, 도로교통법 개정에 있어 다른 유관기관 및 관ㆍ민ㆍ학ㆍ연과의 협의 및 논의가 보다 더 안정적으로 활성화 된 것으로 보인다. 자율주행시대에 있어서는 이제 더이상 교통과 유관한 법들이 독자적 개정이 아닌 다양한 접근 및 논의를 통한 타법과의 개정을 수반할 필요가 있게 된 것이다. 셋째, 우선 상용화될 Lv.3수준의 자율주행자동차에 대한 개정안을 바탕으로 향후 진전될 기술에 탄력적으로 대응하기 위한 개정안인 것을 특징으로 하고 있다.
  이를 바탕으로 우리 도로교통법의 개정방향을 고민해본다면, 우선 인간이 편리하고 안전하기 위해 존재하는 자율주행자동차의 필요성을 적절히 인식한 채 인간의 선택권을 염두에 두고 인간에서 자동차로의 역할변화가 아닌 인간의 역할과 자동차의 역할을 분리하여 고민할 필요가 있다. 또한 자율주행자동차의 등장은 이제 더 이상 차량과 도로교통과의 논의가 분리되던 시대를 지나 차량 및 도로인프라등의 융합이 필요한 시점이 도래된 것이기에 법개정에 있어서도 다양한 접근 및 논의 등이 바탕이 되어야 한다.
  나아가 기술개발 수준에 맞추어 법ㆍ제도적 정비가 이루어지는 것이 타당하기에 아직 미완성된 기술수준에 대한 법의 반영의 난점이 될 수 있겠지만 단계적 실현을 위한 논의 및 법ㆍ제도적 측면의 정비는 필요로 할 것이다. 이에 기술 발전에 대한 예정이 명확하지 않은 입장에서 우선 개정이 필요한 사항부터 순차적으로 진행하는 것이 보다 더 적절할 것으로 보인다.
  따라서 이러한 관점으로부터 우리의 개정 역시 완전자율주행자동차를 바라보고 상상하는 것이 아니라 일단 우선적으로 상용화될 혹은 필요한 사항에 대한 개정안을 바탕으로 하여 향후 이어질 발전의 현실을 살펴가며 탄력적인 대응을 도모하는 것이 보다 더 적절할 것으로 보인다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

자동차라는 문명의 이기가 더 이상은 인사 사고의 매개체가 아닌 환상적인운송수단으로서의 의미를 가지게 될 것으로 보는 4단계(미국자동차공학회에따르면 5단계) 자율주행자동차시대가 도래하면 더 이상은 자동차사고가 발생하지 않을 것이라고 기대할 수 있을 것이다. 그럼에도 불구하고 만에 하나 사고가 발생하게 된다면 이는 자율주행자동차의 시스템결함으로 보아 제조물책임의 법제에 따라 그 배상이 이루어져야 할 것이다. 그러나 문제는 얼마나 유지될지 모르는 3단계 자율주행단계, 즉 제한된 자율운행 자동화단계에서의 법체계와 책임부담방안이다. 이는 현행의 법체계를 유지하여 자동차손해배상보장법에 의한 배상책임 주체인 운행자를 그 1차적인 배상책임자로 하고 자동차보험에 의해 피해자의 보호를 꾀하고 자율주행자동차의 상용화에 부합하는 방향에서 자율주행자동차의 제조상 결함 등을 포함시키는 제조물책임법을 구축하여 자율주행자동차 제조자가 가입한 제조물책임보험에 대한 구상관계를 통하여 이를 해결하는 것이 책임부담방안으로 적정한 것이라고 본다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

첫째, 자동차해체재활용업은 자동차매매업과 동일한 자동차관리사업자의 지위에 있으며, 자동차의 분해 및 해체과정이 있다는 점을 제외하고는 업무내용이 거의 유사하다. 본 연구에서는 조세특례제한법상 자동차해체재활용업자가 인수한 자동차를 재활용폐자원이 아닌 중고자동차로 분류할 때 세액차이를 추산하였다. 전국 부가가치세 납부세액의 차이금액은 141억 1,711만원이고, 개별기업 당 차이금액은 2,736만원으로 나타났다.
둘째, 조세특례제한법에서는 재활용폐자원의 범위를 규정하고 있는데, 자동차해체재활용업은 비사업자와의 취득거래 관련 자료를 국세청에 제출하므로 다른 재활용폐자원업과 구분하여 폐차 요청된 자동차의 취득단계에서 의제매입세액을 적용받을 수 있도록 해야 한다.
셋째, 의제매입세액공제 특례제도의 입법취지에 부합하기 위해서는 환수효과와 누적효과도 제거되어야 한다. 이를 위해 2018년 12월 31일로 일몰되는 조세특례제한법 제108조 제1항을 명확하게 개정하고 그 기간을 연장해야한다.
넷째, 매입형태가 유사한 자동차매매업과 동일하게 자동차해체재활용업도 의제매입세액공제율을 110분의 10으로 상향해야 한다.
본 연구는 실제 자동차해체재활용업을 영위하고 있는 I업체의 자료를 이용하여 자동차해체재활용업계 전체의 의제매입세액 공제대상을 추산하였고, 업무흐름이 유사한 자동차매매업에 비해 의제매입세액 공제율을 다르게 적용받아 발생하는 세액차이를 제시하여 업계에 미치는 영향을 파악하였다는 점에서 공헌점이 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  고도화된 자율주행시스템에 의해 주행하는 자율주행자동차가 야기하는 자동차사고는 사람이 운전에 관여하는 자동차에 비해 현저히 적을 것임에 비추어 보험사고의 발생가능성이 현저히 줄어들게 된다. 그렇다면 대인배상 책임보험의 보험료를 지금과 같은 수준의 보험료로 고집할 필요가 없게 된다. 즉 보험료의 부담이 크지 않게 되므로 자율주행자동차를 운행하기 위해서는 반드시 무제한의 대인배상 책임보험에 가입하도록 함으로써 위 보험 자체를 자동차사고로 인해 인신손해를 입은 피해자를 보호하기 위한 사회보험으로 활용하여 피해자의 손해를 사회구성원 전체에게 분담시키도록 하는 것이 상당하다고 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이 글은 이 같은 현실을 바탕으로 자율주행 자동차의 교통사고 사건을 통해 자율주행 자동차 운행으로 발생할 법적 책임과 그와 관련한 문제들에 대해서 다루었다. 인공지능 시대에 자율주행자동차가 등장하면서 이제 자동차의 개념도 새롭게 설정하여야 할 것이다. 법적인 면에서 자동차 사고와 관련한 경우에 특히 문제가 발생할 수 있는데 대체로 그 책임의 정도를 가늠하기 위한 논의가 중심이 된다. 자율주행자동차는 “운전자는 탑승하지만 목표지점을 설정한 다음에 인위적인 조작 없이 스스로 주행환경을 인식하고 운행할 수 있는 자동차”를 말한다. 이러한 자율주행자동차가 사고를 일으켰을 경우 법적 책임 소재는 복잡한 문제다. 운전자와 자동차 업체뿐만 아니라 사고 원인을 제공할 수 있는 주체가 매우 넓어지기 때문이다. 기계는 인간이 아니다. 인간이 그런 것처럼 기계도 실수하고 사고를 일으킨다. 실제 사회에 존재하는 수많은 자동차 사고에 대한 상황과 변수를 기계적 프로그램의 체계 안에 수렴하는 것은 거의 불가능에 가깝다. 여전히 규제와 발전이라는 경계에 서 있는 셈이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

첫째, 현재 중고자동차 유통에 있어 가장 큰 비중을 차지하는 경로는 중고자동차 매매상사이며 전체 내수 물량의 70%이상을 점하는 것으로 조사되었다. 지속적인 당국의 관리감독 강화와 인터넷 등 신기술 기반으로 새로운 기업들의 도전이 이어지고 있지만, 여전히 한국의 중고자동차 시장은 성능? 상태점검기록부 미교부 또는 위조, 주행거리 조작 등의 문제가 발생하&#xD;
고 있어 장기적 관점에서는 업계 스스로의 자정 노력이 필요한 것으로 판단된다. 둘째, 중고자동차의 주행거리(Km)가 길고 연식(Year)이 오래될수록 소비자 효용의 감소 요인으로 작용하였다. 주행거리와 연식이 각 한 단위 증가할 때마다 Odds비는 63.8%, 57.9% 감소하여, 연식이 오래된 것보다 주행거리가 긴 것이 소비자에게 더욱 강한 효용 감소를 유도하였다. 셋째, C사의 자동차가 신차 시장에서 2016년 전후부터 큰 인기를 얻고 있음에도 불구하고, 중고자동차 선택 상황에서는 A사의 상품이 C사의 상품에 비해 여전히 1.6배 이상의 경쟁력을 보였다. 이것은 한국의 평균 자동차 보유기간이 점차 늘어나고 있는 점과도 관련이 있는 것으로 보이며, 신차 시장에서의 품질 및 디자인 개선이 중고자동차 시장에 영향을 미치는 데는 일정 기간 이상의 시간이 필요한 것으로 해석된다. 넷째, 성능? 상태점검기록부가 교부 되는 경우와 그렇지 않은 경우는 약 5배의 Odds비 증감이 발생하였다. 중고자동차시장에서 소비자가 현재의 성능 및 품질에 매우 큰 관심을 가지고 있으며, 이는 한국 중고자동차시장이 가지는 신뢰성의 문제와 관련이 깊은 것으로 보인다. 다섯째, 중형 중고자동차 선택상황에서 가&#xD;

그러나 현재의 과학기술이 과연 사람의 운전 없이 안전하게 자동차를 주행시킬 수 있는가에는 원천적인 의문이 있다. 무엇보다도 돌발적인 상황에서 사고를 피할 수 없는 경우 시스템이 무엇에 우선 순위를 두어 결정을 내리게 되는지는 어려운 문제이며 법적인 관점, 특히 책임의 관점에서 형사법이 어떻게 판단하여야 하는가는 매우 어려운 문제라고 판단된다.
자율주행자동차에 대한 대부분의 논의는 빠른 상용화에 초점이 맞추어져 있으나 가장 중요한 문제는 실용화와 편리함이 아닌 실질적인 안전성이어야 한다. 이를 위하여 자율주행자동차는 운전의 개념 등 원천적인 고민부터 시작하여 운전자가 직접 운전을 하지 않는다는 측면에서 음주운전이나 무면허운전 등에 대한 정리가 필요하다.
그러나 2019년 제정된 자율주행자동차의 상용화 촉진에 관한 법률은 총29개로 구성된 조문들 중 실제 자율주행자동차의 안전과 직접적으로 연관되는 조문은 거의 없고 시험운행 등에 대한 형식적인 사항들만 기술하고 있다. 또한 동법은 관련법과의 관계도 고려되어야 하지만 교통사고처리특례법상 업무상 과실 또는 중대한 과실로 교통사고를 일으킨 운전자에 관한 형사처벌의 특례 등이 자율주행자동차에도 적용할 수 있는가에 대한 검토는 거의 이루어지지 못하고 있다. 무엇보다 구호의무 미이행 및 도주나 어린이 보호구역에서의 사고 조항 등 여러 조문은 자율주행자동차가 아직 구체적인 상용화를 예정하지 못하는 시기라는 점을 감안해도 전체적으로 아쉬운 측면이 있다. 그리고 불가피하게 발생할 수 밖에 없는 사고와 관련되어 보험규정이 책임보험만 형식적으로 규정된 부분은 향후 자율주행자동차의 상용화를 감안하면 상당히 미흡하다.
이러한 측면에서 자율주행자동차는 부분자율주행과 완전자율주행의 구분부터 명확하게 설정되어야 하며 우선적으로 사람의 개입이 필요한 부분 자율주행자동차에 초점을 맞추어야 한다. 즉 자율주행자동차가 상용화 되더라도 일정 기간 추이를 살펴보며 운전자에게 일정 의무를 부과하는 것이 타당하며, 부분 자율주행자동차가 실제 운행에 문제가 없다는 것이 일정 기간 동안 증명되고 이후 자율주행 시스템만으로 주행이 가능하다는 것이 충분히 입증된 이후 완전 자율주행자동차에 대한 논의가 부가되어 진행되어야 한다고 판단된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

국내 승용차와 전체 시장 잠재규모를 Gompertz 확산 모형을 이용하여 추정한 결과 2,298.58만대로 전망되었다. 국내 자동차 시장에서 휘발유, 경유 등 내연기 관 자동차가 전기자동차(xEV)로 전환된다고 가정한 뒤 국내 전체 전기자동차 (xEV)의 확산 경로를 Gompertz 모형으로 추정하였는데, 이 때 미래의 자동차 시장에서 내연기관 자동차가 전기자동차(xEV)에 의해서 완전히 대체된다는 가 정과, 각각 50%씩 차지하게 될 것이라는 가정 하에서 전기자동차(xEV)의 확산 과정을 추정하였다. 전기자동차가 내연기관 자동차를 전부 대체한다는 가정 하 에서, 2050년에 전기자동차(xEV)는 약 2,005.3만대까지 시장을 확대할 것으로 나타나 전체 승용차 시장에서 89.9%를 차지할 전망이다. 전기자동차와 내연기관 자동차가 시장을 양분한다는 가정 하에서는, 2050년에는 국내 승용차 시장 에서 전기자동차(xEV)가 차지하는 비중이 47.7%(1,063.0만대)에 달할 것으로 예 상되었다.
보수적으로 전기자동차(xEV)의 미래 시장을 전망하여도 2030년에는 약 400 만대가 보급될 것으로 분석되고 있다. 앞으로 전기자동차의 시장 확산 속도는 빨라질 것이기 때문에 이에 대한 준비를 해야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

자율주행자동차를 개발하는 목표는 사고 없는 자동차운행이다. 즉 안전이 최우선목표이다. 그럼에도 불구하고 자율주행자동차의 운행으로 인한 사고가 발생한다면 그 책임의 주체는 누가될 것인가가 끊임없는 법적인 논제이다. 완전자율주행자동차(레벨5)는 운전자나 승객의 조작이 필요 없는 것이니 운전자는 책임주체로서 고려대상이 되지 아니한다. 그러나 부분자율주행자동차(레벨3)와 관련해서는 운행자나 보유자, 그리고 자율주행시스템의 제조자 또는 자율주행자동차의 제조자 심지어 판매자가 책임주체가 될 여지가 있다.
자동차 운행으로 인한 사고와 관련하여 그 책임의 분담을 지금까지 보험제도가 하였던 것 역시 부분자율주행자동차의 경우에도 크게 달라질 것 같지 않다.
다만 그것을 기존의 자동차배상책임보험제도로 할 것인지 아니면 제조물의 하자나 흠결로 보는 제조물책임보험으로 할 것인지 그도 아니면 제3의 제도가 필요할 것인지를 정하여야 한다. 자율주행자동차가 타인에게 사고를 유발한 경우 이것이 자율주행자동차 자체의 결함으로 인한 것이라면 제조물의 하자를 이유로하여 제조물책임에 따른 제조물책임보험으로 하는 것도 한 방법이지만 제조물의하자를 증명하는 증명책임부담 등의 문제로 인하여 피해자 측에게는 그다지 유리할 것이 없다. 자율주행자동차의 경우는 운전자가 필요 없는 것이지만 운행이익을 가지고 있는 운행자는 존재한다. 그러므로 기존의 무과실책임원리(또는 위험책임원리) 하에서의 운행자책임으로 문제를 해결하는 방식을 원리 그대로 적용하는 것이 피해자 보호에 가장 적절하다고 보인다. 이때 운전자와 피해자를동시에 보호하는 단일보험증권모델을 채용한 자동차의무보험으로 운용하는 것을방안으로 제시한다. 레벨5인 완전자율주행자동차의 경우는 보험을 통한 책임분담은 비효율적이므로 정부보장사업의 형태로 그 제조물책임의 위험을 분산하는것을 제안한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,자율주행자동차 사고의 민사책임," 자율주행(자동)차, 자동차손해배상보장법, 운행자책임, 제조물책임, 불법행위책임, Autonomous Vehicle, Automobile Compensation Guarantee Act, Operator Responsibility, Product Liability, Tort Liability","독일의 자동차교통법 제7조를 계수한 우리나라의 자동차손해배상보장법 제3조는, 운전자와 기계가 복합된 자동차의 위험에서 기인하는 자동차 주행이 만들어 낸 사고를 대상으로, 자동차의 운행자에게 엄격한 책임을 묻고 있으며 사실상 무과실책임에 가깝다고 할 수 있다. 그 법적 근거는 자동차 운행의 위험을 지배할 수 있는 사람에게 엄격한 책임을 부과하는 위험책임과 자동차의 운행으로 인해 이익을 얻는 자에게 불이익을 부과하는 보상책임에서 구할 수 있으며, ‘운행지배’와 ‘운행이익’을 모두 갖는 자를 자동차 운행자라고 정의하여 법적 책임을 지우고 있다. 그리고 이러한 자율주행차의 손해배상책임은 자동차보험제도와 관련이 있다. 자율주행의 단계가 상승함에 따라, 사고의 원인으로서 물적 위험인 자동차 자체의 결함과 고장에 기인하는 비중이 증대함으로 인하여, 제조물책임이 많은 문제가 될 것이다. 그러나 제조물책임법을 자율주행차의 결함에 대해 적용하는 데는 몇 가지 문제점이 있다. 즉, 자율주행 소프트웨어를 제조물법책임법상의 제조물로 볼 수 있는지의 여부이다. 이에 대해서, 자율주행 소프트웨어가 자동차의 차체와 일체화되어 있다는 점을 인식하여, 소프트웨어의 결함은 동산인 자동차의 결함이라는 해석을 채용할 수 있다. 이러한 제조물의 결함의 유형 중, 특히 설계상의 결함과 표시상의 결함이 문제가 된다. 자동차손배법의 운행자책임과 제조물책임법의 제조물책임은 모두 자율주행차에 의한 제3자의 인신사고에 적용될 수 있다. 그런데, 사고의 원인이 자율주행차의 결함에 있으면서도 일정한 사실들에 대한 입증의 부담 때문에, 운행자책임이 제조물책임을 떠맡는 문제가 발생할 수도 있다. 그리고 자동차손배법 제3조의 손해배상책임의 범위에는 재산상의 손해를 포함하고 있지 않기 때문에, 운전자가 탑승하지 않는 자율주행 ‘제5단계’에서는 피해자의 보호에 미흡할 소지가 있다. 이러한 문제의 해결은 자동차보험 및 입증책임과 관련이 있다. 또한, 자율주행차가 제3자의 해킹 등에 의해 시스템이 방해·교란을 받아 사고를 일으킨 경우에 관한 민사책임 문제도 있다. 결국, 민사책임의 주체는 자율주행차의 운행자, 제조업자 등으로 책임의 구도가 다원화되므로, 이들 사이의 책임의 분배를 합리적으로 조정할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

재물보험인 자기차량손해보험에서는 자신의 차량의 고가성 여부에 따라 보험료가 달리 책정되는 반면, 책임보험에서는 차량가액에 큰 의미가 부여되지 아니한다. 그런데 책임 보험의 경우 책임의 주원인이 된 자와 상대적으로 책임의 원인을 가볍게 제공한 자 사이의 책임부담의 정도가 사고원인의 비율인 그 정도차이, 예컨대 과실의 정도의 차이가 아닌, 각자가 가진 잠재적 위험의 크기 차이에서 비롯되는 것이라면 이는 배분적 정의로 다시 교정되어야 하는 것은 아닌지를 문제삼고자 한다. 이에 책임보험, 특히 대물책임보험에서 자동차모델에 따른 보험료차등 부과방식을 제안하고자 한다. 이는 자동차 가액을 감안한 자동차모델에 따른 보험요율을 차등책정하는 방식으로 각 자동차 모델에 따른 손해빈도 및 평균 손해금액 등을 기준으로 보험요율(위험율)에 차이를 두는 것이다. 고가차의 증가현상이 꾸준한 가운데 대물배상책임보험에서의 역차별이 심각하고 실제 경미한 과실임에도 불구하고 상대차량의 가액이 초고가임에 따라 실제로는 피해자에 해당하는 자가 과도하게 배상을 해야 하는 문제가 개선되어져야 할 것으로 판단된다. 그러한 측면에서 이를 책임 보험료에 반영하는 것이 바람직하다고 본다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

연구방법 자동차 전면의 라디에이터 그릴이 사용자의 감성에 어떤 영향을 미치는지 살펴보기 위해 11대의 자동차 라디에이터 그릴을 간략하게 시각적 정보로 정성화하였다. 각 라디에이터 그릴의 형태와 크기가 사용자 감성에 미치는 영향을 판단하기 위해 12가지 감성어휘를 선정하였고 각 어휘별로 5점 리커드 척도를 적용하여 판단하게 하였다. 45명의 성인을 대상으로 감성어휘 평가를 수행하였으며 ANOVA를 통해 분석하고, 각 감성어휘별로 보통이상(3.0점)으로 평가된 항목을 순위별로 정리하였다.




연구결과 현대자동차의 플루이딕 스컬프쳐 2.0 디자인이 적용된 라디에이터 그릴의 경우 사용자들에게 주로 점잖고, 모던한, 고상한 감성을 불러일으킨 반면에 센슈어스 스포티니스가 적용된 라디에이터 그릴은 경쾌한, 화려한, 다이나믹한 감성을 느끼게 하였다.

2020,자동차세의 국제비교와 형평성 분석 = International Comparison and Equity Analysis of Automobile Taxes,"Automobile tax,luxury tax,price,tax reform,engine displacement,자동차세,사치세,가격,조세 개혁,배기량","자동차세는 자동차 소유에 대한 자동차세와 자동차 주행에 대한 자동차세로 구분된다. 우리나라의 경우 자동차세 세율이 배기량에 따라 정해지기 때문에 재산과세로서의 성격이 점점 약화되고 있다. 현재의 우리나라 자동차세는 1991년 배기량 기준으로 세율이 책정된 이래 30년이 지나도록 과세표준이 배기량으로 고정되어 있어, 자동차에서 재산적 측면, 이용적 측면, 환경적 측면에 대한 고려가 이루어지지 않았다. 특히 저가의 자동차와 고가의 자동차에 대한 자동차세 과세가 동일한 문제를 안고 있다. 가격이 국산차의 2~5배에 달하는 고가 수입차량도 배기량만 같으면 동일한 자동차세를 부담하기 때문에 세부담 불형평성을 야기하고 있다.
본 연구에서는 자동차세에 대한 외국 과세 현황과 과세기준을 살펴보아 합리적인 자동차 과세 방안을 논의하고, 자동차세가 과연 형평성 있는지를 지방자치단체간 및 개인간 차원에서 살펴본 후, 이를 토대로 우리나라 자동차세 개선 방안을 논의하고자 한다. 개인간 자동차세 형평성은 11차년도 재정패널조사 데이터를 이용하였는데, 이는 2018년도의 자료로 현재로서는 가장 최근의 재정패널조사이다. 외국의 과세 현황은 인터넷 조사 및 문헌조사로 살펴본다.
유럽의 취득 단계 자동차세 과세를 보면 부가가치세 이외에 다양한 기준이 활용되고 있으며, 재산과세 성격을 고려한 차량가격 뿐만 아니라, 환경을 고려하기 위하여 CO2 배출량이 사용되고 있으며, 미국의 경우는 연방정부가 사치세를 부과하고 있으며, 캘리포니아주에서는 재산세와 유사한 차량면허세(Vehicle License Fee: VLF)가 있다. 코네티컷의 경우 5만달러를 기준으로 차량가격에 따른 세율의 차등을 두고 있다. 영국의 경우는 차량가격이 4만파운드(약 6,200만원)인 경우에는 약 50만원 정도의 사치세가 매년 부과된다.
본 연구에서는 우리나라 자동차세의 제도 개선 방안으로 재산과세 성격을 강화하기 위하여 일정 가격 이상의 자동차에 대해서는 자동차 사치세를 부과하는 방안을 제시하고 이의 지역별 효과를 검토한 후에, 지방자치단체 고유재원으로 하지 않고, 귀속지를 조정하여 중앙이 아닌 지방이 거두어 해결하는 방식을 제안한다. 이는 자동차 관련 사치세의 도입이 재정불균등을 더욱 심화시키기 때문이다.
본 연구에서는 외국의 사례를 참고하여 차량교체주기를 7년으로 가정하고, 자동차세의 재산과세 성격을 강화시키기 위하여 4,000만원 이상의 자동차, 5,000만원 이상의 자동차, 6,000만원 이상의 자동차에 추가적인 사치세를 부과하였을 경우의 효과를 살펴보았다. 자동차세 사치세의 도입을 하고 현재의 상태대로 세수입을 배분한다면 재정불균등을 더욱 심화시킨다. 따라서 자동차세 사치세를 도입하는 경우, 지방분권세와 같은 형식으로 하고 귀속지를 조정하여 중앙이 아닌 지방이 거두어 해결하는 방식으로 하여, 지방의 균형발전을 위한 재원으로 하는 것이 바람직할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  독일은 오랜 논의 끝에 자율주행자동차의 규제를 도로교통법에 규정하였다. 특히 독일의 경우 자율주행 국면에서 발생하는 교통사고의 책임소재를 분명히 하기 위해 차량통제를 즉각적으로 재개 (unverz?gliche Wiederaufnahme der Fahrzeugsteuerung)해야 할 의무를 운행관리자에게 부여하고 있다. 스위스의 경우에는 아직 법개정이 이루어지지 않았지만, 연방도로청(Bundesamt f?r Strassen)의 연구보고서에서 자율주행자동차의 운전자, 형사책임, 민사책임, 정보보호, 정보보안 관련된 법제화 방안에 대한 원칙적인 입장이 제시되었으며, 현재 법제화를 위한 작업이 진행되고 있다.
  시론적 수준에서 형사법적 쟁점으로는 도로교통법상의 운전자의 개념과 주의의무의 변화, 사고책임의 귀속여하, 정보보호 및 정보보안이 문제될 수 있다. 특히 형사책임 귀속주체의 확정을 위해 사고발생 당시 주행 통제권의 주체, 즉 운전자성을 누구 혹은 무엇에게 인정할 수 있는지의 문제가 선결되어야 한다. 운전자성이 긍정되는 행위주체가 확정된다면 사고 발생 시 주의의무위반 여부가 판단되어야 할 것이다. 이에 따라 비자율주행모드에서 인간 운전자가 책임귀속의 주체로 상정되는 것은 전통적인 자동차의 경우와 동일하다(Level 0?Level 2). 자율주행모드(Level 3)에서는 비상상황에서 ‘즉각적으로 재개(unverz?gliche Wiederaufnahme der Fahrzeugsteuerung)’ 의무를 부담하는 인간 운전자와 제조자 등의 과실이 문제될 수 있다. 마지막으로 완전자율모드에서는 인간 - 운전자 내지는 생산에 관여하는 자 - 이 아닌 자율주행자동차 자체에 책임을 물을 수 있느냐의 문제가 제기될 수 있다. 그러나 현행 형법이론은 형벌권 행사의 전제로 행위자의 범죄능력과 책임능력을 전제하기 때문에 비인간적 존재인 자율주행자동차 ? 나아가 인공지능 -이 형사책임의 주체가 되기 위해서는 마찬가지로 범죄능력과 책임능력이 인정되어야 한다. 그러나 이는 인간을 전제로 하는 것으로 비인간적 존재의 범죄능력과 책임능력의 문제는 다시 매우 어려운 문제에 봉착하게 된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

일반적으로 자율주행자동차에서 발생하는 책임과 손해배상의 문제를 해결하기 위해서 주로 자동차손해배상보장법(이하 ‘자배법’이라 한다)과 제조물책임법을 적용하여 접근하고 있다. 현재 우리나라는 자동차손해배상책임제도가 있어 자동차 소유자는 가입이 의무화(강제가입) 되어 있다. 제조물책임법은 자율주행자동차에 탑재되어 있는 프로그램에 결함이 있어 그 결과로 사고가 발생했을 경우 자동차 제조업자가 손해배상책임을 지는 것이다. 이 경우 제조업자가 법적 책임을 부담하게 되면 제조?판매에 대한 의욕을 잃을 수 있으며 반대로 피해자가 손해배상책임의 입증책임을 부담하게 되면 결함이나 과실을 입증하지 못할 경우 배상금을 받지 못하는 결과가 초래할 수 있기 때문에 피해자구제라는 목적에는 현저히 불공평한 측면이 있다. 따라서 이 둘의 딜레마적 관계를 현명하게 해결할 법적 제도가 필요하다.

2018,국내 자동차 산업의 경쟁력 제고 방안,,"■ 개 요
최근 자동차 산업은 양적 성장이 둔화되는 가운데 파괴적 혁신이 가속화되고 있어 위기와 기회가 공존하고 있는 상황이다. 최근 한국GM의 군산공장 폐쇄 발표 등으로 국민적 우려가 증폭되는 상황에서 본고에서는 자동차 산업 경쟁력 제고를 위한 방안을 모색한다.
■ 국내 경제에서 자동차 산업의 중요성
자동차 산업은 우리나라의 대표적인 주력산업이자, 소재·부품부터 서비스까지 전후방으로 연계된 산업이 많아 경제 전체에 미치는 파급효과가 매우 크다.
한국GM이 국내에서 완전 철수하는 경우, 연간 생산 손실분은 30조 9천억원, 부가가치 손실분은 8조 4천억원으로 추정되며, 총 취업자 감소분은 9만 4천명에 이를 것으로 예상된다.
■ 자동차 산업 경쟁력 제고 방안
① 미래 기술에 대한 연구개발 투자 확대가 시급하다.
한국 자동차 산업은 연구개발에 대한 투자를 지속적으로 확대해 왔으나 여전히 세계적 수준에는 미약한 상황이다. 자동차 미래 신기술의 상용화 전 실험적 단계에서 신기술에 대한 연구개발 투자 및 지원을 빠르게 결단할 필요가 있다.
② 부품·소재 기업 육성을 위한 공생(共生)구조를 확립해야 한다.
기존의 완성차 중심의 산업구조에서 탈피하여, 부품·소재 기업 육성 및 경쟁력강화를 통해 자동차 산업의 새로운 성장 모멘텀을 확보할 필요가 있다. 특히, 미래 자동차 패러다임의 변화에 대응하여 부품 산업의 R&D 지원을 강화해야 한다.
③ 생산성 제고 및 경영 효율화 방안 마련
국내 자동차 산업의 생산성 제고를 위해 체계적인 원인 분석을 통한 효율화 방안마련이 필요하다. 주요국의 고용 유연화 및 안정화 사례를 벤치마킹하여 노사 모두 원·윈 할 수 있는 방안을 모색할 필요가 있다.
④ 자동차의 서비스화에 대비한 투자 확대가 필요
미래 자동차 산업의 경쟁력은 서비스 플랫폼 경쟁력에 의해 좌우될 가능성이 높다. 모빌리티 서비스, 인포테인먼트 플랫폼 등 자동차의 서비스화가 활발히 진행되고 있는 부문에 대한 투자를 증대할 필요가 있다.
■ 시사점
자동차 산업의 지각변동이 혁신적 산업 생태계 조성의 계기가 될 수 있도록 정부와 업계의 각성과 노력이 필요하다. 첫째, 자율주행차, 전기자동차 등 미래 자동차 기술에 대한 연구개발 투자를 강화하고 인력 양성에 주력해야 한다. 둘째, 완성차 업체와 2, 3차 협력업체가 공생할 수 있는 혁신지향적 경쟁환경 조성을 위해 노력해야 한다. 셋째, 생산성과 유연성을 제고하는 한편, 고용 안전망을 확충하는 데에도 유의해야 한다. 넷째, 소비자에게 새로운 가치를 제공하는 혁신적 서비스모델이 활성화될 수 있도록 관련 규제를 혁신할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

특히 유럽에서는 중동부유럽국가의 EU가입이후 EU내 산업생산은 빠르게 중동부유럽으로 이전하고 있다. 대표적인 사례가 서유럽국가에서 중동부유럽국가로 자동차 산업생산이 이전하고 있는 점이다. 벨기에와 같은 국가에서는 다국적 기업이 생산기지를 이전하면서 자국 내 자동차 생산이 붕괴되었다. 프랑스와 이탈리아에서는 자국에서 자동차 생산이 급격하게 감소하였다.
그런데 똑같은 EU 단일시장의 혜택을 받게 된 중동부 유럽국가 중에서도 체코 등 특정국가에서 자동차 산업생산이 빠른 속도로 증가하였다. 또한 프랑스와 이탈리아의 사례와는 다르게 독일에서는 자동차 생산의 급격한 감소가 이루어지지 않았다.
본 논문은 서유럽에서 중동부 유럽으로 자동차 산업이 이전하고 있는 현황에 대한 분석을 진행하고 또한 중동부 유럽국가 중 체코에서 자동차 생산이 급증하고 있는 원인에대해서 체코투자청 인터뷰를 통해 얻은 자료를 통해서 분석을 진행하도록 한다.
특히 한국에서 자동차 생산이 급격하게 감소되고 있는 상황에서 유럽에서 중동부 유럽으로의 자동차 생산기지 이전 사례가 주는 함의를 도출한다. 한국의 경우, 국내에서신규 자동차 조립공장은 1998년 완공된 삼성자동차의 부산공장을 마지막으로 만들어지지 않았다. 특히 국내 자동차 산업의 대표기업인 현대자동차 그룹은 1995년 아산공장 준공이후 신규 자동차 조립공장을 국내에서 건설하지 않았다. 반면에 현대자동차 그룹은해외생산을 지속적으로 확대하고 있다.

2018,한국형 자동차레몬법의 입법(立法)과 이행과제 = Enactment of the Korean Lemon Law and the Implementation of the New System,"레몬법, 자동차레몬법, 자동차관리법, 자동차 교환·환불 제도, 중재, 레몬법 중재, 교환·환불 중재, Lemon Law, Automobile Lemon Law, the Automobile Management Act, Automobile Refund or Replacement System, Arbitration, Lemon Law Arbitration, Refund or Replacement Arbitration","2017년 10월 국회에서 「자동차관리법」의 개정으로 자동차 교환 환불제도가 처음 도입되었다. 이 한국 레몬법 입법으로 새로 구입한 자동차에 하자가 있을 경우 구매자가 제작사에게 교환 또는 환불을 요구할 수 있는 권리 및 그 권리 발생 요건을 법률로 규정하였고 교환 또는 환불 요구와 관련된 분쟁을 해결하기 위하여 교환·환불 중재제도가 도입되었다. 한국 레몬법 입법으로 소비자인 차량소유자의 권리 보호가 강화되는 반면 자동차 제작사의 책임은 다소 증가할 것이다.
지금까지 한국의 자동차 결함(하자)으로 인한 자동차 교환 또는 환불 요건과 그 분쟁해결은 「소비자분쟁해결기준」에 따른 소비자원의 소비자분쟁조정위원회의 조정으로 그 분쟁의 해결을 시도하여 왔다. 그러나 「소비자분쟁해결기준」은 고시(告示)로서 구속력이 없고 소비자분쟁조정위원회의 조정 역시 당사자들이 그 조정안을 수락을 하는 경우에만 구속력을 발생하는데 실제로 분쟁당사자가 조정안을 수락하는 예는 매우 드물었다.
교환·환불 요건의 대상 자동차는 새로 구매한 비사업용 자동차와 차량 1대를 소유한 개인사업자의 자동차이다. 또한 해당 자동차가 하자발생시 신차로 교환·환불할 것 등이 포함된 서면계약에 따라 판매된 차량이어야 한다. 교환·환불의 하자요건은 그 하자로 인해 차량의 안전이 우려되거나 경제적가치가 현저히 훼손되거나 또는 차량의 사용이 곤란해야 한다. 제작사의 수리시도와 관련한 교환·환불의 하자요건은 자동차를 인도받은 날로부터 1년 또는 주행거리가 2만 킬로미터 이내로서 중대한 하자는 2회 이상, 일반 하자는 3회 이상 수리를 하고도 같은 증상의 하자가 시정되지 않거나 또는 총 누적 수리기간이 30일을 초과하는 경우이다. 이 수리시도 요건과 관련하여 중대한 하자는 1회, 일반 하자는 2회를 수리 후 시정에 실패한 경우 하자차량 소유자는 하자 제작사에게 반드시 하자재발통보를 하여야 한다. 이와 같은 교환·환불요건은 미국의 각 주의 자동차레몬법 제도와 흡사하다.
또한 EU ‘소비재매매와 관련 보증 지침’과 같이 소유자에게 인도된 날부터 6개월 이내에 발견된 하자는 인도시점부터 존재하는 것으로 추정하여 자동차소유자(소비자)가 부담하는 증명책임을 완화하고 교환·환불 요구권의 제척기간을 자동차를 인도받은 날로부터 2년으로 규정하였다.
소유자의 교환·환불의 요구를 해당 제작사가 거부하여 분쟁이 발생한 경우로서 제작사와 차량 소유자 모두가 교환 환불 중재규정을 수락한 경우 교환 환불 분쟁은 자동차안전하자심의위원회의 중재로 해결된다. ‘캐나다 자동차 중재 계획(Canadian Motor Vehicle Arbitration Plan: CMVAP)’과 유사하게 교환·환불중재는 차량제작사와 소유자 모두가 중재규정을 수락하는 것으로 중재합의를 구성하고 그에 따른 자동차안전·하자심의위원회의 중재부가 내리는 중재판정에 양 분쟁당사자들이 구속되는 일반적인 형태의 중재로 분류할 수 있다.
이 한국 레몬법은 2019년 1월 1일 발효된다. 따라서 현재는 새로 도입되는 자동차 교환환불 제도의 원활한 개시와 정착을 위한 원활한 제도 시행 및 안착을 위한 준비로서 하위법령, 즉 시행령과 시행규칙을 개정하여야 한다. 자동차안전·하자심의위원회가 제·개정권을 갖는 교환·환불 중재규정안도 신속하게 마련되어야 한다. 중재부의 원활한 심리와 신속하고 객관적인 판단을 도모함으로써 중재판정의 일관성과 신뢰성을 확보할 수 있도록 비교적 상세하고 명확한 중재규정이 필요하다. 특히 중재규정을 입안할 때 자동차 교환· 환불제도는 한국에 처음 도입되는 제도이고 우리 국민이 중재제도나 문화에 익숙하지 않은 점도 충분히 고려되어야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

따라서 한국 정부와 자동차 업계는 일-EU EPA로 유럽 및 독일시장에서 가일층 치열해질 수출경합에 대비한 다각적인 대응책을 조속히 마련하여야 할 것으로 보인다. 특히 독일 자동차시장 내 틈새시장의 지속가능한 확보를 위해서 기존의 저가형 소형차 수출전략보다는 고품질-고부가가치형 경차·소형차 수출특화전략과 전기·수소자동차 특화전략으로의 궤도수정이 시급히 선행되어야 할 것으로 보이며, 한국자동차의 탈(脫)개도국 이미지화와 자동차 기술 강국으로의 이미지 개선을 위해서 자동차 핵심부품소재와 모듈·시스템의 최첨단화 및 국제인증을 통한 수출품목군 다변화를 동시에 추구해야 할 것으로 사료된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그러므로 한국자동차산업의 대독일 무역역조현상을 극복하고 수출경쟁력을 제고시키기 위해서는, 첫째로 고품격-고부가가치형 ‘강소(?小)자동차’로의 중장기적 특화전략 추구, 둘째로 절대수입특화품목에 대한 수입대체공업화와 대표수요론에 입각한 내수기반 수출촉진전략 추구, 셋째로 국내수요가 증가하는 독일산 자동차 부품의 국산화, 국산부품의 사용승인 및 인증마크 획득, 규격통일 등 제도적 장치 마련, 넷째로 독일시장을 공략하기 위한 수출전략품목의 강화, 마지막으로 EU 환경규제를 대비한 전기 및 수소자동차의 조속한 타깃형 수출전략 마련이 필요할 것으로 보인다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그 이유는 피보험자동차의 경우와 달리 주자, 정차중의 위험에까지 이 보험의 범위를 확대하게 되면 다른 자동차의 일시사용에 의하여 발생하는 위험을 추가보험료도 징수하지 않고담보하는 본 특약의 취지에 반하는 것이라는 데에 존재한다. 도로교통법 제2조 제25호에 의하면 정차는 운전자가 5분을 초과하지 아니하고 차를 정지시키는 것으로서 주차 외의 정지상태를 말한다. 타차운전 특약에서는 주차, 정차중의 사고를 부보 대상에서 제외하고 있다.
피보험자동차이외에 다른 자동차를 운전하다가 사고가 난 경우를 예외적으로 부보하는 것으로서 위험을 고려하여 주차, 정차중의 사고를 면책으로 하고 있는 것이다. 주차의 개념과정차의 개념은 도로교통법의 개념정의 규정을 차용할 수 있다. 그에 의하면 본 사안에서 차주가 동승자를 내려주기 위하여 차를 멈추었고 동승자가 차문을 여는 순간 오토바이가 와서사고가 난 경우는 정차중의 사고에 해당한다고 보아야 한다. 따라서 다른 자동차운전담보특약에서 면책에 해당한다고 하여야 한다. 하지만 대법원 판결에 대한 비판적 입장 내지는 개선 제안으로서 다른 자동차 운전 특별약관에서 정차의 면책사유를 삭제하는 것을 고려할 필요가 있다. 현재로서는 보험가입자, 운전자의 입장에서는 자동차보험의 원리, 면책사유를 감안하여 운전을 할 때에도 주의를 기울이는 것이 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,사용자 컨텍스트 기반의 자율주행 자동차 공유 서비스 경험프레임워크 개발에 관한 연구 = A Study on User Context-based Development of Experience Framework for Autonomous Vehicle Sharing Service,"사용자 경험,차량 공유 서비스,자율주행 자동차,주제 분석,경험프레임워크,User Experience,Car Sharing,Autonomous Vehicle,Experience Framework","연구배경: 최근 ‘소유’의 개념이 아닌 ‘경험해본다’의 개념으로서의 소비 형태 변화와 공유 경제가 활발해 짐에 따라 차를 개인이 소유하는 것 대신 한 대의 차를 여러 사람이 공유하는 차량 공유 시장이 성장하고 있다. 또한 정보 통신 기술과 자율주행 자동차 기술이 발전하고 보편화되면서 자동차는 기존 대중 버스나 지하철과 같이 ‘공유’되는, 서비스로서의 이동성(Mobility as a Service, MaaS)이 중시된 수단으로 변화되고 있다. 자율주행 자동차 기술의 발전과 함께 자율주행 자동차를 활용한 차량 공유 서비스가 개발됨에 따라 자동차 안에서의 경험과 서비스로서의 이동성과 관련된 사용자 경험에 관한 연구가 중요해지고 있다. 현재 안전에 대한 기술적인 연구는 활발하게 이루어지고 있지만, 서비스로서의 이동성 측면에서 자율주행 자동차를 바라보았을 때의 사용자 컨텍스트와 공유 서비스 개발 시 고려되어야 하는 환경 및 사용자 경험에 관한 연구는 상대적으로 미흡한 실정이다.


연구방법: 본 연구에서는 연구 대상을 이해하기 위하여 기존 차량 공유 서비스와 자율주행 자동차 관련 문헌 조사를 진행하였다. 차량 공유 서비스 사용 상황/목적 및 사용자 행동에 영향을 미치는 컨텍스트 요소(Context Factors)를 파악하기 위하여 현재 국/내외에서 상용화되어 있는 차량 공유 서비스와 미래 자율주행 자동차 공유 서비스 컨셉 사례를 분류하고 분석하였다. 더불어 현재 차량 공유 서비스 이용자들의 경험 및 니즈를 파악하기 위하여 사용자 인터뷰를 진행하였고, 자율주행 자동차 공유 서비스의 핵심 컨텍스트 요소 및 방향성을 도출하기 위해 UX 전문가 인터뷰를 진행하였다. 수집된 인터뷰 데이터를 바탕으로 주제 분석(Thematic Analysis)을 진행하였고 자율주행 자동차 공유 서비스에서 고려될 수 있는 사용자 경험의 대표 테마를 도출하여 경험프레임워크를 제작하였다. 또한 경험프레임워크의 유용성에 대하여 검증을 진행하였다.


연구결과: 분석 결과 자율주행 자동차 공유 서비스 개발 시 1) 사용자의 생활 패턴, 선호 정보를 통한 차량 내부 환경 맞춤화, 2) 사용자 상황 및 맥락 정보와 같은 통합 데이터를 활용한 자율주행 자동차 서비스 접근의 중요성, 3) 사용자 위치 및 선호 정보 기반의 정보 큐레이팅, 4) 생활 속 이동 공간 개념으로 변하고 있는 자율주행 자동차, 5) 동승자 존재 시 안전/보안 이슈에 대하여 중요하게 고려를 해야 한다는 것을 알 수 있었다.


결론: 자율주행 자동차가 차량 공유 서비스로 활성화되었을 때에는 운전 면허증의 유/무, 나이, 이동 거리 및 위치와 관계없이 생활과 밀접한 주문 개념의 이동 경험을 제공하고, 다양한 분야의 서비스와 결합되며 융합된 정보를 통해 개인 맞춤화 경험 등 사용자에게 새로운 차량 경험을 제공할 것으로 기대된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,EU회원국의 운송분야 기후변화 대응: 프랑스정부와 르노자동차의 전기자동차 전략을 중심으로 = EU Member States Response to Climate Change in Transport: Electric Vehicle Strategy of French Government and Renault,"EU,기후변화,회원국,프랑스,르노자동차,EU,Climate Change,Member-states,France,Renault","EU는 중국에 이은 전 세계 2위의 전기자동차 시장이다. EU운송분야는 EU전체 탄소배출에서 에너지산업 다음으로 큰 비중을 차지하는 분야가 되었다. EU운송분야의 탄소배출 감축노력에 따라서 전기자동차 이용이 EU시장에서 빠른 속도로 활성화되고 있다. 특히 전력생산분야에서 높은 원자력발전 의존으로 운송분야가 차지하는 탄소배출 비중이 가장 높은 비중을 차지하고 있는 프랑스에서 전기자동차 전략은 정부와 기업차원에서 의욕적으로 추진되었다.
1990년 대비 EU온실가스배출을 급격하게 감소하였다. 그러나 운송분야에서 온실가스 배출 감축은 다른 분야에 비해서 매우 더디게 진행되고 있다. 따라서 EU차원에서도 운송분야에서 온실가스 배출을 감축하고 친환경 모빌리티를 확대하려는 시도가 지속적으로 이루어지고 있다. 2019년 12월 EU 집행위원회는 ‘유럽 그린딜’을 발표하였고, 유럽 그린딜을 통해 2030년 온실가스 감축 목표를 기존의 1990년 대비 40% 감축에서 50~55% 감축으로 상향 조정하고 2050년 탄소중립을 목표로 설정하였다. 유럽 그린딜은 2050년 탄소배출 제로를 달성하기 위해 4개 분야(에너지, 산업 및 순환경제, 건축, 운송)와 2개 주요 정책분야(친환경 농식품, 생물다양성 보존)를 제시하였다.
이와 같은 EU차원의 대응과 더불어, 프랑스 정부도 적극적으로 전기자동차 지원정책을 실행하였다. 프랑스 정부는 보너스-말러스 시스템을 도입하여 친환경 자동차 구매 인센티브를 제공하였다. 2017년 니콜라 윌로 프랑스 환경부 장관은 2040년까지 휘발유와 경유 차량 판매를 점차 줄여 2040년 이후부턴 전면 금지하겠다고 선언하였다. 2019년 5월 18일에는 내연기관 자동차 판매를 금지하는 법안의 수정안이 프랑스 하원의 지속가능발전국토개발 상임위원회를 통과하였다.
2020년 상반기 EU에서 가장 많이 판매된 전기자동차 모델은 르노자동차의 조에(ZOE)였다. 르노자동차는 다른 주요 자동차기업에 비해서 일찍 전기자동차의 중요성을 파악하고 이에 대한 준비를 하였다. 카를로스 곤 회장은 2008년 도쿄 자동차 박람회에서 르노자동차가 전기자동차를 2010년부터 상용화하고 2012년부터 대량 판매할 것이라 선언하였고, 2012년에 르노의 전기자동차인 ‘조에(ZOE)’가 출시되었다. 특히 한국의 LG화학은 2010년르노자동차와 전기자동차 배터리 공급계약을 체결하였고, 르노자동차와 LG화학의 협력은 지속적으로 발전하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,친환경등급에 따른 서울시 자동차 운행제한 제도 도입방안,,"2018년 4월 환경부는 자동차 배출가스 등급 산정방식을 변경하고 이를 고시하였다. 서울시는 환경부 고시 등급에 따라 시내 일부 지역에서 오염물질 다배출 차량의 도심운행제한을 시행할 계획이다. 이 연구는 서울시의 자동차 오염물질 배출특성, 시민수용성, 기대 효과 등을 분석해 효과적인 자동차 운행제한 제도의 도입방안을 마련하고 중장기 계획을 수립하였다.
도심 자동차 운행제한, 왜 필요한가?
  최근 서울시의 초미세먼지 고농도 일수가 증가하고 있으며, 이에 따른 시민 건강영향이 심각한 상황이다. 해외 주요도시는 핵심 대기오염 관리정책으로 ‘도심 자동차 운행제한’제도를 시행하고 있다. 이들 도시는 오염물질 배출이 많은 자동차의 운행을 제한할 때 얻을 수 있는 사회적 편익이 치러야 할 비용보다 크다는 점을 확인하고, 사회적 합의를 거쳐 점진적으로 제도를 강화하고 있다. 서울보다 초미세먼지 농도가 낮은 도시도, 서울처럼 월경성 오염물질 유입 비중이 높은 도시도 자체 미세먼지 배출량을 줄이기 위해 노력하고 있다는 점은 시사하는 바가 크다. 아울러 자동차 운행제한으로 온실가스 감축, 교통혼잡 개선, 교통사고 감소 등 추가적인 공편익(co-benefit)을 거둘 수 있다는 측면에서 서울시는 오염물질 다배출 차량의 상시적 운행제한 제도를 도입할 필요가 있다.
자동차 운행제한 제도, 성공하기 위한 조건
  서울시민 대상 설문조사 결과, 대다수 시민은 국내에서도 미세먼지 발생을 줄이기 위한 노력이 필요함을 인지하고 있으며, 그 대책 중 하나인 ‘친환경등급에 따른 자동차 운행제한’에 찬성하고 있다. 그뿐 아니라, 많은 시민은 현재 정부가 검토하고 있는 안보다 더 강력한 방식으로 자동차 운행제한 제도를 시행하기를 바라고 있다. 이러한 긍정적인 시민인식에도 불구하고, 제도 도입 반대 의견을 가진 시민의 특성을 살피고 공공 협의를 바탕으로 수용성을 더욱 높여 나갈 필요가 있다.
서울시 자동차 운행제한은 대상차량·지역 감안해 단계별 시행 필요
  시행 초기에는 서울시 자동차의 오염물질 배출특성, 시민 수용성, 기대 효과, 기술적 측면 등을 고려해 녹색교통진흥지역 내 5등급 차량만을 대상으로 한 상시 운행제한부터 시행할 것을 제안한다. 이후 중장기적으로 서울시 전역에서 3등급 이하의 모든 차량을 상시 운행제한 하는 방향으로 제도를 강화해 나가야 할 것이다. 서울시 전역에서 4~5등급 차량의 운행제한을 시행하면, 서울시 도로수송 부문 초미세먼지 총배출량은 약 28%가 줄어들 것으로 전망된다. 자동차 운행과정에서 나오는 비산먼지와 2차 생성분까지 추가로 고려하면 감축 효과는 더욱 높아질 것으로 기대된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

본 논문은 자동차 산업에 차체 분야의 신기술로 떠오르고 있는  핫스템핑 공법과 관련된 도입 현황을 고찰하고, 이를 확산·전개할 수 있는 방안을 모색하고자 하였다. 특히 해외 원천기술이었던 핫스템핑 공법을 한국 시장에 적용한 사례를 통해 최근 국내 차체 시장에 대한 분석과 핫스템핑 공법이 자동차 산업 내 미치는 영향에 대해 고찰하였다. 또한, 자동차 차체 시장에서 핫스템핑 공법 패러다임에 대해, 포터(M. Poter)의 다이아몬드 모델을 활용하여 종합적으로 분석하였다. 끝으로, 향후 국내 자동차 차체 부품업계의 나아갈 방향과 핫스템핑 공법을 활용한 확대 방안 모색 등 기업 경쟁력 제고측면에서의 전략적 시사점도 제시하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,징벌적 손해배상제도와 상당성의 원칙* - 자동차제조사의 3배 징벌적 손해배상제도의 문제점을 중심으로 - = The Punitive Damages and Reasonableness,"Punitive damages,reasonableness,actual damages,product liability,the treble damages,징벌적 손해배상,상당성의 원칙,실제손해,제조물책임,3배 손해배상",우리나라에서는 이른바 2018년에 있었던 BMW 차량화재사건의 대응책으로 자동차 제작결함에 관련하여 5배징벌적 손해배상제도의 입법화가 시도되어 국회에 제출되었지만 최종적으로 성공하지 못했다. 이러한 상황에서는 자동차 제작결함에 관련한 징벌적 손해배상은 제조물책임법에서 정한 3배징벌적 손해배상제도에 의해서 다루어질 수밖에 없는 상황이라고 할 것이다. 지난 2018년에 이어 2019년에도 BMW차량관련 화재사건이 또 발생했다는 것을 검토해보면 과연 3배 징벌적 손해배상제도가 징벌적 손해배상제도의 주요기능이라고 할 수 있는 억제기능(deterrence)을 효과적으로 발휘하고 있는지에 대한 의문이 든다. 미국의 경우를 살펴보면 자동차를 다른 제조물과 달리 특별한 규정에 의한 징벌적 손해배상의 대상으로 규정하고 있는 입법례는 미국 50개주 어디에서도 찾아볼 수 없고 자동차를 제조물의 하나로 보아 제조물책임의 대상으로 보고 있다. 자동차관련 징벌적 손해배상액에 관련해서 살펴보면 연방대법원은 BMW of North America. Inc. v. Gore(517 U.S. 559 (1996))판결과 State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell(538 U.S. 408(2003))판결을 통하여 보상적 손해배상의 9배 이상의 징벌적 손해배상은 위헌으로 추정된다는 원칙을 확립하였다. 이러한 연방대법원의 선례에 따라 몬테나주 법원에서도 ㈜현대자동차에 대하여 9배 징벌적 손해배상을 인정하는 판결을 하였다. 오늘날 자동차는 더 이상 사치품이 아니며 국산차가 전세계 시장으로 팔려나가고 많은 외제차를 국내 소비자들이 구입하여 사용하고 있는 것도 사실이다. 이러한 현실에서 거의 유사한 자동차 제작결함으로 인한 사고가 발생하더라도 한국에서 사고가 발생하면 3배 징벌적 손해배상의 적용을 받고 미국에서 사고가 발생하면 9배 징벌적 손해배상의 대상이 된다는 것은 내?외국인에 대한 간접적 차별현상의 가능성을 열어 놓고 우리 국민을 안전성이 확보되지 않은 제품의 시험대상으로 노출시킬 우려마저 있다. 자동차관리법을 개정하여 5배 징벌적 손해배상제도를 도입하려던 우리정부의 입법시도는 외국산 자동차들이 넘쳐나는 우리나라 자동차 시장에서 국민을 보호하기 위한 조치였다고 평가될 수 있었지만 아쉽게도 입법화에 실패하였다. 입법화 실패에는 여러 가지 원인이 있었겠지만 자동차도 제조물의 하나에 해당하므로 제조물 책임법에 규정하고 있는 3배 징벌적 손해배상의 적용대상이 된다는 점도 고려되었을 것으로 짐작된다. 우리나라 징벌적 손해배상제도의 도입에 많은 참고 사항을 제공하였던 미국의 징벌적 손해배상제도의 현황과 자동차 제작결함관련 징벌적 손해배상판결례를 고려할 때 제조물 책임법의 3배 징벌적 손해배상제도를 개정하여  9배 징벌적 손해배상제도를 도입하는 것이 이미 생활필수품이 된 자동차의 제품결함으로부터 우리 국민의 안전을 확보하는 방안이 될 것이라 사료된다.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,자율주행자동차 사고의 제조물책임법 적용에 관한 연구 - 소프트웨어의 제조물성 근거규정 도입에 대하여 - = A study of the Application of Product Liability Law to Autonomous Vehicle Accidents - Regarding the introduction of applicable provisions that the software is a product -,"Autonomous Vehicle,Autonomous Driving Software,Autonomous Vehicle Accident,Autonomous Driving Traffic System,Product Characteristic,Product Liability,Product Liability Law,자율주행자동차,자율주행소프트웨어,자율주행자동차 교통사고,자율주행도로교통시스템,제조물성,제조물책임,제조물책임법","자율주행자동차는 자율주행보조장치와 이를 제어하는 자율주행소프트웨어에 의하여 스스로 목적지까지 운행할 수 있는 차량을 말한다. 현재 개발되는 자율주행자동차는 자동차 자체에 인공지능에 해당하는 자율주행시스템이 부착되어 있는 형태이며, 자율주행시스템은 첨단운전자보조장치들을 통합할 뿐만 아니라, 다른 차량들로부터 정보를 수집하고 수집한 정보를 다른 자율주행자동차의 자율주행장치에 제공하는 상호정보교환을 하며 스스로 주행 환경을 판단하는 방식으로 작동하고 있으며, 이러한 자율주행보조장치들을 제어하여 자동차가 스스로 운전할 수 있게 해주는 프로그램이 자율주행소프트웨어이다.
오늘날 자율주행자동차의 기술은 전 세계적으로 발전하고 있으며, 우리나라에서도 2020. 7.부터 차량의 조향과 가?감속, 제동 등을 모두 자동으로 수행하여 실질적으로 자율주행이 가능하지만 돌발 상황에서는 운전자가 개입을 해야 하는 조건부 자동화 단계인 레벨3 자율주행 기술을 탑재한 자동차가 상용화될 예정이다.
지금까지의 자동차 사고는 주로 운전자의 과실이나 자동차의 결함으로 인한 것이었으므로 그 민사책임도 민법상의 불법행위책임이나 제조물책임의 법리를 통하여 해결해 왔다. 그러나 자율주행자동차 상용화 시대에는 운전자 외적인 요인으로 인한 사고, 즉 자율주행소프트웨어의 결함 등으로 인한 사고가 대부분일 가능성이 매우 높다. 그러므로 자율주행소프트웨어 제조업자의 책임을 명확히 하여 소비자 보호와 더불어 피해자를 구제할 필요성이 있다.
하지만 현행 제조물책임법은 제조물의 정의를 ‘동산’으로 한정하고 있기 때문에, 자동차에 탑재된 자율주행소프트웨어의 결함으로 인한 사고에 제조물책임의 법리를 적용하는데 있어 학설상 찬반양론이 대립되고 있으며, 실제로 이를 적용하는 데는 일정한 한계가 있다. 그러므로 제조물책임법상의 제조물 개념에 소프트웨어를 포함하는 규정을 도입하여야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,자동차 전손사고시 보험자의 잔존물 거래실태와 관련된 문제점 고찰 - 전손의 판단과 잔존물대위의 관점에서 - = A Study on the Problems of Transactions about Insurer’s Remaining Property in Automobile’s Total Loss Accident : in terms of Subrogation and the Judgment of Total Loss,"TSubrogation by Insurer Concerning Subject Matter of Insured,Total Loss,Motor Vehicle Management Act,Automobile,Automobile Insurance,First Party Property Damage Insurance,Property Damage Liability Insurance,잔존물대위 ∥ 전손사고 ∥ 자동차관리법 ∥자동차 ∥ 자동차보험 ∥ 자기차량손해∥ 대물배상","자동차사고로 인한 전손사고 시 보험자는 원칙적으로 중고가격에 해당하는 교환가액 상당액을 피보험자(피해자)에게 지불하고 상법 제681조(잔존물대위)의 규정에 따라 법률상 당연히 잔존물에 대한 권리를 취득하게 된다.
보험자는 이렇게 취득한 잔존물을 잔존물(매매)업자에게 매각해서 잔존물가액을 환입하고있는데 이 경우 잔존물대위의 법리에 따른 소유권 취득 시 자동차관리법 상 자동차의 명의이전등록이 필요할 수 있으며, 만약 보험자가 이러한 절차 없이 자동차를 매매할 경우 자동차관리법 위반의 문제와 취?등록세를 탈루하는 조세법 위반의 문제, 그밖에 전자상거래 등에서의 소비자 보호에 관한 법률위반, 상법위반 등의 문제가 발생하게 된다. 또한 보험자가자동차관리법에 부합되게 자동차관리사업자로 등록을 하고 손상 및 폐차대상 자동차의 매매및 알선행위를 한다고 할지라도 과연 보험자가 보험업과는 무관한 이러한 사업을 영위하는것이 보험업법 규정에 비추어 허용되는지 여부가 문제로 지적될 수 있다. 그 밖에도 전손차량의 폐차 또는 매각과 관련해 보험자가 자의적으로 전손에 해당하는지 여부를 일방적인 기준에 의해 판단함으로써 차주(車主)에게 손해를 끼친다는 점이 문제로 지적된다.
이와 같이 보험자가 잔존물대위에 따른 업무를 처리함에 있어 파생되는 문제점을 해결하기 위한 방안으로 보험자가 잔존물의 매각절차에 직접 개입하지 않고 차주와 잔존물(매매) 업자를 연결만 시켜주고(물론 차주나 잔존물업체로부터 매매·알선 수수료 등을 받지 않는조건), 전손보험금의 지급을 차주와 매매업자간에 차량의 명의이전이 완료된 후 잔존물금액을 공제한 나머지를 보험금(손해배상금)으로 지급하는 방식으로 업무를 처리할 것을 제안한다. 이 방식에 의할 경우 보험자는 잔존물에 대한 명의이전이 필요 없게 되어 잔존물(자동차)에 대한 소유권을 취득하지 않아도 되므로 자동차관리법 상 매매업자로 등록을 할 필요가 없어지고, 손해사정이론상으로도 보험자는 보험금액에서 잔존물의 가치를 공제한 차액을보험금으로 지급함으로써 굳이 잔존물대위의 법리를 통하지 않고서도 업무처리를 신속하게진행할 수 있다는 장점이 있다.
물론 개선된 업무처리 방안에 의하더라도 문제점이 전혀 없어지는 것은 아니지만 본 논문은 보험자의 잔존물처리 관행에 대한 문제점들을 정리·검토하고, 이를 바탕으로 현행 보험법 체계 하에서 잔존물 대위의 적용 요건(전손의 판단기준 포함)과 근거에 대해 어떻게 이해하고 적용해야 하는지에 대한 고찰을 통해 필자 나름의 개선안을 제시하고자 하였다. 보다 거시적이고 근본적인 관점에서의 연구와 더 발전된 개선(해결)방안에 대해서는 향후 검토 과제로 남겨두고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,자율주행자동차 상용화를 위한 법규 제·개정 필요성 검토 = A Study on the Need to Enact and Revise Laws for Commercialization of Autonomous Vehicles,"자율주행자동차,SAE 기술단계,도로법,도로교통법,자동차관리법,Autonomous Vehicles,SAE Level,Road Act,Road Traffic Act Automobile Management Act.","최근 제4차 산업혁명이 화두로 떠오르고 있으며 인공지능, 로봇공학, 사물인터넷, 나노기술 등이 대표적인 분야로 떠오르고 있다. 자율주행자동차 또한 이러한 4차 산업혁명의 주요 분야로 얘기되고 있으며 2020년 상용화를 목적으로 하고 있다. 자율주행자동차는 운전자의 조작없이 자동차의 기능을 통해서 운행하는 차량을 말하는 것으로 이러한 새로운 개념의 차량이 도입되기 위해서는 미리 법과 제도를 통해 준비할 필요가 있다.
우리나라는 자율주행자동차 산업에 있어서 후발주자로 빠르게 선진국들을 따라잡아야 하는 입장이다. 해외 선진국에서는 이미 법·제도적으로 논의가 이루어지고 있으며 법률이 제·개정되고 있다. 국내에서도 법률 제·개정 움직임을 보이고 있고 국내 연구에서도 자율주행자동차와 차량중심으로 자동차관리법이나 사고의 법적 책임, 보험 등에 대해서 논의되고 있지만 더 다각적인 논의가 필요하다.
이를 위해서 자율주행자동차와 관계있는 여러 법과 제도들을 살펴볼 필요가 있고 이를 다각적으로 검토해야 한다. 이를 위해서 자율주행 관련 법·제도를 규제적인 측면, 제조·허가 측면, 관리 측면, 운행 측면, 사고의 법적책임, 인프라 구축의 6가지 측면으로 살펴보았다. 규제적인 측면에서는 자율주행자동차의 시험운행이나 도로주행에 관해서 규제가 완화될 필요가 있고 제조나 허가 측면에서는 도로환경이나 날씨와 같은 운행환경에 따른 기능의 정의와 운행을 위한 기준이 정의될 필요가 있다. 그리고 관리적인 측면에서는 첨단기술이 적용된 자율주행자동차의 관리주체의 선정과 일반적인 차량보다 정기적인 검사빈도가 짧을 필요성이 얘기되었고 운행 측면에서는 일반차량과 같이 운행되기 위해서 기술적 측면의 완성과 자율주행차량 운전자 의무완화 등을 얘기하였다. 사고의 법적 책임에 있어서는 3단계까지는 운전자가 개입이 크기 때문에 현행 법제도가 적용될 수 있지만 이후 단계에서는 운전자나 탑승자보다는 제조사와 시스템설계사 등의 책임을 입증하는 것이 문제가 될 것으로 나타났다. 그리고 인프라 측면에서는 효율적이고 안전한 운행을 위해서는 도로정보의 디지털 인프라 구축과 정보통신망의 연계가 중요한 것으로 얘기되었다.
2020년 올해 자율주행자동차의 상용화를 목전에 두고 있기 때문에 법·제도적인 준비는 반드시 필요하다. 또한 후발주자로서 다른 선진국들을 추격하고 안정적인 국내도입을 위해서도 법률과 제도의 다각적인 검토가 있어야 한다. 앞서 얘기한 법·제도들 외에도 자율주행자동차의 상용화와 관련된 법률들은 더 많을 것이기 때문에 이후에도 지속적이고 추가적인 연구가 이어져야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(연구방법) 본 연구의 방법은 다음과 같다. 선행연구로 브랜드 공간에서의 체험마케팅의 중요성과 브랜드공간에서 체험 요소에 관한 이론 고찰을 하고 자동차브랜드공간에서의 Bernd H. Schmitt‘체험 마케팅’과 Pine & Gilmore‘체험4요소(4Es)’분류 방식을 적용된 체험마케팅의 구성요소를 분석 및 그 특성을 살펴보고자 한다.  체험 특성이 적용된 국내외 자동차 브랜드의 국내 브랜드 공간을 답사해 체험마케팅이 적용된 연출 방식을 바탕으로 공간 구성의 기준을 세우고 분석을 통하여, 국내 자동차 브랜드 공간 연출 요소에 체험마케팅이 적용된 효율적인 연출 요소가 적용된 공간의 방향성과 발전 가능성을 제안한다. (결과) 분석결과 체험마케팅의 전략 중 4Es에서는 일탈적 체험 요소가 가장 잘 나타나있고 다음으로 오락적 체험 요소가 뒤를 이었다. 일탈적 체험으로 소비자는 공간에서의 비일상적 체험을 통해 좀 더 몰입감 있는 브랜드에 대한 경험을 제공한다. 또한 오락적 체험으로 오감을 통한 감각적 체험을 흡수한다. SEMs에서는 감각 체험 마케팅과 감성 체험 마케팅 요소가 뒤를 이었다. 감각적, 감성적 체험 마케팅의 요소는 고객의 자발성과 감정 이입 되며 더욱 효과적인 체험 마케팅의 요소로 보여 진다. (결론) 이를 통해 자동차 브랜드 공간은 공간 내에 체험 요소를 활용한 체험마케팅의 차별화와 브랜드 공간과 브랜드 이미지를 재정립하는데 중요한 요소로써의 방향성과 확장성을 제시 할 수 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,다른 자동차 운전담보 특약에서 보험자의 보상책임 발생요건에 관한 약관의 문제점과 개선안 연구 - 대법원 2018. 7. 12. 선고 2016다202299 판결 - = A Case Study on the Improvement and Problem of Clauses about Requirements of the Insurer‘s Liability in the Special Clause for Driving a Another Car,"다른 자동차운전 담보 특약,주차,정차,운전 중,일시정지,자동차보험,피보험자,the special clause for driving a another car,parking,stop,while driving,temporary stop,automobile insurance,the insurer","일상생활 가운데 자동차를 사용하다 보면 때때로 피보험자 자신의 차량이 아닌 다른 사람의 자동차를 운전하게 될 경우가 많은데 만약 그 차량이 의무보험만 가입되어 있거나 ‘운전자한정’ 혹은 ‘연령한정’ 특별약관에 가입하고 있는 경우 일시적으로 무보험 상태에 놓이게 된다. 이 때 사고가 발생한 경우 그 다른 사람의 차량을 자신이 가입한 자동차보험의 피보험차량으로 간주해 운전자 자신이 가입한 보험으로 보상처리를 해줌으로써 피해자와 운전자를 보험의 공백으로부터 구제해주는 특별약관이 바로 ‘다른 자동차 운전담보 특별약관’이다.
이 특약에 의한 보험자의 보상책임요건은 피보험자가 다른 자동차를 운전 중 생긴 대인·대물사고와 자기신체사고(또한 자동차상해)에 대해 보통약관에서 규정하는 바에 따라 보상하게 되는데 ‘주·정차 중’에 발생한 사고는 제외되는 것으로 약관에 규정 하고 있다.
대상 판결은 다른 자동차 운전담보 특약을 가입한 피보험자가 다른 자동차를 운전 해서 가다 승객의 하차를 위해 2차로 가장자리에 차량을 일시정지 시켰고, 승객이 하차를 위해 뒷문을 여는 순간 지나가던 오토바이를 충격해 부상을 입힌 사고이다. 이에 대해 대법원은 해당 사고는 ‘정차 중’에 발생한 사고로 해당 약관상 보험자의 보상책임이 없다고 판단하였지만, 사고 당시 피보험자는 시동을 끄지 않은 상태에서 뒷좌석에 앉아 있던 승객에게 바로 내리도록 하였고, 또 운전석을 벗어나거나 차량에서 내려 승객의 하차를 돕는 행위를 하지 않았던 것은 ‘일시정지 중’이어서 여전히 운전 중에 있었다고 평가해야지 이를 ‘정차’로 판단한 것은 잘못이라 생각한다. 특히 대법원은 다른 자동차 운전담보 특약에서 보상책임을 정한 규정의 단서조항인 ‘주·정차중 사고 제외’에 대한 해석을 약관에도 정의한 바 없는 도로교통법상의 주·정차 개념을 준용 해서 해석함으로 인해 지나치게 문리적으로 경직된 해석을 하였고, 이로 인해 피해자와 피보험자 보호에 공백이 생기는 문제를 야기하였다.
이러한 문제를 해결하기 위한 약관 개선안으로 단서조항의 내용 중 ‘정차’ 부분은 삭제하거나, 아니면 대인배상과 대물배상책임의 경우에는 ‘주·정차 제외’ 조항 모두를 삭제하고 “운전자가 차량에 탑승 중인 경우에 한해 보상한다”는 조건을 부기하면 좋겠 다. 궁극적으로는 위 특약에서 말하는 ‘운전’의 해석은 도로교통법에서 정의하고 있는 ‘운전’과는 다른 것으로 해석되어야 하므로 해당 약관에서 규정하고 있는 보상책임조 항의 내용을 “보험회사는 피보험자가 ‘다른 자동차’를 사용 또는 관리하던 중 생긴(중 략) ~”로 개정할 것을 제안한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2008～2016년 재정패널조사를 활용해 디젤게이트의 외부효과를 분석하기 이전에 차량 소유 종류별 수요함수를 분석한 결과, 부동산자산과 금융자산이 많을수록, 소득수준이 높을수록, 학력 수준이 높을수록, 자영업자일수록 독일 자동차 수요가 증가하였다. 반면 연령이 증가할수록, 가족 수가 많을수록, 임금근로자일수록 독일 자동차보다는 다른 차량을 소유하거나 차량 자체를 소유하지 않는 경향이 강했다. 외부효과 분석 결과에서는, 폭스바겐의 디젤게이트가 다른 독일 브랜드 차량(벤츠, BMW, 아우디)의 수요를 감소시키는 부정적 외부효과를 발견하지 못했으며, 이는 독일 자동차에 대한 국내 소비자의 충성도가 상당히 높다는 것을 의미한다. 다만 본 연구에서는 2015년에 발생한 폭스바겐의 디젤게이트가 다른 독일차 수요에 미치는 단기적인 외부효과를 분석하는데 한정되었기 때문에 향후 추가 자료를 통해 장기영향을 분석해 볼 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

자율주행자동차의 기술단계 중 가장 높은 단계의 자율주행자동차는 자동차의 주행에 인간의 관여가 전혀 없는 자동차이며 이러한 자동차의 경우 운전자가 누구인가? 혹은 운전자 개념이 필요한 것인가에 대해 의문이 생기게 된다. 그리고 이러한 의문은 자율주행자동차에 대한 법적 규제를 마련하는 것에 선행하여 반드시 필요한 논의가 될 것이다.
인공지능이 법인격 부여의 대상이 될 수 있는가에 대한 논의는 지속적으로 이루어지고 있으며 인공지능에 법인격을 부여해야 한다는 주장은 여러 가지 측면에서 제기되고 있다. 예를 들면 인간의 행복증진을 위한 인공지능의 활용을 위해서 인공지능에게 법인격을 부여하자는 주장이나, 인공지능이 독자적으로 재산을 소유하도록 할 정책적 필요성이 인정된다면 재산을 소유하는 연결점으로서의 권리주체성을 인정할 수 있다는 주장이 있다. 또한 법률행위의 주체와 관련하여 현재의 법인도 실체를 가지는 존재가 아니지만 필요에 의해 권리와 의무의 주체로 인정받고 있음에도, 인간과 유사한 행위를 할 수 있는 인공지능은 기존의 법인에 비해 오히려 더 인간과 유사한 법률행위를 하는 주체이기 때문에 법인격을 인정할 수 있다는 주장 등이 그러하다.
이러한 결론에 도달한다면 인간운전자가 필요하지 않은 자율주행자동차의 경우에는 실질적으로 자동차를 제어하는 인공지능이 운전자가 될 수 있다는 결론에도 도달할 수 있을 것이다. 그리고 자율주행자동차의 운전자로서 인공지능이 가지는 의미와 법적 책임 등에 대해서도 논의가 필요할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

독일은 오랜 논의 끝에 자율주행자동차의 규제를 도로교통법에 규정하였다. 특히 독일의 경우자율주행 국면에서 발생하는 교통사고의 책임소재를 분명히 하기 위해 차량통제를 즉각적으로 재개(unverz?gliche Wiederaufnahme der Fahrzeugsteuerung)해야 할 의무를 운행관리자에게 부여하고있다. 스위스의 경우에는 아직 법개정이 이루어지지 않았지만, 연방도로청(Bundesamt f?r Strassen) 의 연구보고서에서 자율주행자동차의 운전자, 형사책임, 민사책임, 정보보호, 정보보안 관련된법제화 방안에 대한 원칙적인 입장이 제시되었으며, 현재 법제화를 위한 작업이 진행되고 있다.
시론적 수준에서 형사법적 쟁점으로는 도로교통법상의 운전자의 개념과 주의의무의 변화, 사고책임의 귀속여하, 정보보호 및 정보보안이 문제될 수 있다. 특히 형사책임 귀속주체의 확정을 위해사고발생 당시 주행 통제권의 주체, 즉 운전자성을 누구 혹은 무엇에게 인정할 수 있는지의 문제가선결되어야 한다. 운전자성이 긍정되는 행위주체가 확정된다면 사고 발생 시 주의의무위반 여부가판단되어야 할 것이다. 이에 따라 비자율주행모드에서 인간 운전자가 책임귀속의 주체로 상정되는것은 전통적인 자동차의 경우와 동일하다(Level 0?Level 2). 자율주행모드(Level 3)에서는 비상상황에서 ‘즉각적으로 재개(unverz?gliche Wiederaufnahme der Fahrzeugsteuerung)’ 의무를 부담하는인간 운전자와 제조자 등의 과실이 문제될 수 있다. 마지막으로 완전자율모드에서는 인간 ? 운전자내지는 생산에 관여하는 자 ? 이 아닌 자율주행자동차 자체에 책임을 물을 수 있느냐의 문제가제기될 수 있다. 그러나 현행 형법이론은 형벌권 행사의 전제로 행위자의 범죄능력과 책임능력을전제하기 때문에 비인간적 존재인 자율주행자동차 ? 나아가 인공지능 ? 이 형사책임의 주체가 되기위해서는 마찬가지로 범죄능력과 책임능력이 인정되어야 한다. 그러나 이는 인간을 전제로 하는것으로 비인간적 존재의 범죄능력과 책임능력의 문제는 다시 매우 어려운 문제에 봉착하게 된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

개정된 「도로교통법」 제1조의a는 각각의 기능이 의도한 대로 사용되는 경우에만 고도로 또는 완전자동주행기능을 사용할 수 있는 것으로 허용하였다. 따라서 의도된 사용과 자동화 정도에 주의를 기울이는 것이 중요하다. 무엇보다도 제조업자의 시스템설계가 결정적이라고 할 수 있다. 이때, 의도된 사용요건이란 고도로 또는 완전한 자동주행기능을 가진 자동차가 도심의 일반도로에서 주행을 하는 경우에 운전자가 일정조건이나 상황에서 운전자가 직접 운전하지 않고, 자동주행기능을 장착한 자동차가 운행할 수 있는 조건과 상황을 정하여 자동주행기능을 이용할 수 있도록 하는 것을 의미한다. 
또한 동법 제1조의a제3항은 “고도로 자동화된 또는 완전자동주행기능을 장착한 자동차”는 운전자가 필요한 경우에 수동으로 운전을 할 수 있는 기능을 장착하도록 정하고 있다. 이러한 규정은 운전자가 언제든지 그리고 필요할 때에는 지체없이 수동으로 직접 운전할 수 있도록 하는 기능이 “고도로 자동화된 또는 완전자동주행기능을 장착한 자동차”에 장착되어 있어야 한다는 것을 의미한다. 아울러 “고도로 자동화된 또는 완전자동주행기능을 장착한 자동차”도 프로그램의 오작동이나 자동차의 기계적 고장 등으로 더 이상 자동적으로 정상적인 운행을 할 수 없다는 것을 운전자가 인식할 수 있도록 설계되어야 한다. 이렇듯 명확한 설명이 필요한 것은 운전자가 일반적으로 차량을 조종하고 실질적인 권한을 가진 유일한 사람으로 간주된다는 전제에 근거한다. 동법 제1조의b에 따르면 운전자에게는 고도로 또는 완전자동주행기능을 이용하는 때에, 해당 기능의 시스템이 수동운전을 요구하거나, 또는 운전자가 수동운전의 필요성을 인지하였을 때 해당 자동차의 조정을 수동으로 전환하여야만 하는 의무가 부여된다.
또한 부분적으로 자동화된 자동차는 주행 중에 이미 많은 정보를 수집하고 처리하고 있다. 고도로 또는 완전자동주행기능을 장착한 자동차는 이보다 훨씬 많은 정보를 수집하게 되고, 지속적으로 확보되는 분량을 확대하게 된다. 자동주행을 위해 필요한 내비게이션 및 위치 데이터, 환경 데이터, 주행성능 데이터 등이 제어시스템과 네트워킹의 향상만큼 증가하기 때문이다. 축적된 데이터를 처리하는 과정은 개인정보처리에 관한 법률상 규제가 적용되며, 해당 데이터는 기술적인 활용 외에도 교통사고를 둘러싼 손해배상 등에도 사용될 수 있다.

그간 연간 국내에서 2백만 대에 가까운 자동차가 판매되고 그 가운데 수많은 자동차들이 리콜되고 있으나, 정작 교환이나 환불과 같은 근본적인 구제책은 이루어지고 있지 못하였다. 이런 가운데 지난 2017년 12월 24일 자동차관리법에 도입된 일명 ‘한국형 레몬법’은 자동차의 현재 또는 잠재적 소비자에게 대단히 기대감을 갖게 하는 입법이라 할 만하다.
하지만, 도입된 한국형 레몬법에 대해서는 피해구제에 미흡하다는 지적과 동시에 과잉구제로 인해 자동차산업을 위축시킬 것이라는 우려가 대두되고 있다. 이 제도가 자동차 소비자를 피해로부터 충실히 구제해 줄 것인지에 대한 정확한 평가는 제도의 실행과정을 좀 더 지켜 본 후에 가능할 것이다. 다만 법리 및 제도론적 측면에서 검토의 여지는 존재한다고 본다. 나름의 절충과 현실에 대한 고려 끝에 산출된 결과 제도의 본원과는 다소의 거리가 있는 외형이 만들어졌는데, 이런 형식적 특징들이 소비자정책은 물론 법제적으로도 적절한지에 대한 평가는 필요하다.

배기량에 대한 대안으로 가장 빈번하게 제시되고 있는 차량가액 기준은 자동차세의 재산세적 성격을 가장 잘 반영한다는 장점이 있다. 그러나 차량 운행으로 유발되는 도로 손상이나 환경오염 등 환경적 요소를 반영하는 데에 한계가 있다. 또한 이미 취득단계에서 차량가액 기준으로 개별소비세, 취득세 등 6개 세목의 조세가 부과되고 있어 이중과세라는 지적이 있을 수 있다. 차량가액 기준을 적용할 경우 대체로 고가의 수입차에 대한 세액은 증가하고 저렴한 국산차에 대한 세액은 감소할 것으로 보이는바, 국산차 비중이 아직은 큰 상황에서는 세수 감소가 예상되고, 차종 간의 세율 차이는 통상 마찰을 유발할 가능성도 있다.
이산화탄소 배출량 또는 연비에 의한 과세는 환경오염 억제에 가장 효과적이다. 이미 EU에서는 자동차의 배기가스량을 엄격하게 규제하는 동시에 회원국들에게 자동차세제에도 이산화탄소 배출량 또는 연비와 같은 친환경적 요소를 반영하도록 적극적으로 권고하고 있다. 우리나라 역시 국제적 합의에 따라 이산화탄소를 비롯한 온실가스 배출량을 감소시켜야 할 의무를 지고 있다. 자동차는 현대생활에서 없어서는 안 될 필수적 재화이지만, 자동차의 배기가스는 환경오염의 주된 원인이 되고 있는 만큼, 장기적으로 환경오염 감소에 효과적인 이산화탄소 배출량 또는 연비 기준으로의 개편이 이루어져야 할 것이다. 이를 위하여 이산화탄소 배출량 또는 연비를 기준으로 하는 과세체계에 대한 연구와 그 기준을 신뢰성있게 측정하기 위한 제도의 정비가 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이는 독일시장에서 한국자동차의 저가경쟁전략이 브랜드인지도, 친환경성, 디자인으로 구성되는 비가격경쟁력과 자동차 구매의사에 하등의 영향을 미치지 못한다는 것을 의미한다. 반면에 자동차의 제품 성능, 안전성/안정성, 연비로 대변되는 품질경쟁력은 브랜드 인지도 등의 비가격경쟁력에 영향을 미칠 뿐만 아니라, 한국자동차의 구매의사에도 직접적으로 영향력을 행사한다는 것을 묵시적으로 보여주고 있다. 결국 한국자동차의 독일시장 수출활성화를 위해서는 저가경쟁전략을 자제하고 품질경쟁으로 정면 승부를 걸어야 승산이 있을 수 있다는 점을 시사하고 있다. 또한 마케팅 차원에서 응급고장수리 발생빈도가 높은 수출자동차의 보증수리기간 연장 및 부활, 한국자동차 매도시 중고차가격에 대한 안심서비스 프로그램 개발, 국제원조수혜국에 대한 인도적, 비영리적 공공마케팅 활동과 Mecenat를 통한 한국자동차의 브랜드 이미지 제고 등이 고려될 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

자율주행자동차의 완성도를 제고하려는 다양한 시도가 이루어지고 있다. 자율주행자동차는 도로에 설치된 교통 인프라와 소프트웨어가 삽입된 자율주행시스템 사이의 통신에 의해서 운전이 자동화되는 방식이 일반적이다. 이러한 자동화 방식의 핵심 요소인 소프트웨어는 고도의 정보처리시스템으로 정보의 수집과 축적, 가공 등과 같은 정보처리의 중요성이 증가하고 있다. 본고에서는 이러한 인식 하에서 자율주행시스템에서 핵심적 기능을 수행하는 소프트웨어를 중심으로 정보의 가용성ㆍ완전성ㆍ기밀성의 관점에서 자율주행자동차의 운행과 관련된 기술적 권한과 시스템에 대한 책임, 운전자의 불법행위책임, 정보제공자의 책임, 사생활 보호를 위한 책임 등 다양한 형태의 책임을 검토 하였다.

나아가 안전성을 위해 차량은 운전환경과의 통신 등을 통해 연결성(Connectivity)을 갖출 것이다. 이러한 연결성으로 제조업자의 책임에 미치는 영향은 독일의 제조물 감시의무가 참고가 된다. 손해발생 가능성이 높은 자동차 등은 능동적 제조물 감시의무가 있다. 다만 어떻게 감시해야 하는가에 대한 문제가 존재하나 연결성을 갖추게 되면 이러한 문제를 해소할 가능성이 있다. 한편 AEV법은 안전상 중요한 업데이트를 피보험자 등이 게을리 한 경우 보험회사의 책임 감면을 규정하고 있다. 그러나 안전상 중요한 업데이트가 필요한 경우 제조업자의 책임에 대해서는 규정이 없고 차량의 유통 이후에 제조물 책임이 아닌 일반 불법행위의 문제가 된다. 하드웨어면의 교환·회수와 소프트웨어면의 교환·회수를 동일하게 볼 수 없으므로 추가적인 검토가 필요할 것이다.
또한, 피해자와의 손해의 공평한 분담을 고려한다면, 독일의 입법처럼 차량에 운전자가 있는 경우 문제가 없다고 해도 영국의 입법과 같은 경우 반드시 운전자의 존재를 전제로 하지 않는 경우 문제가 발생한다. 따라서 영국의 AEV법과 같은 차량의 움직임을 과실로 취급하는 것은 이러한 문제에 대응하기 위해 ‘과실기준’은 어떠한 것이어야 하는지가 향후 추가적인 논의가 필요할 것이다.


본고에서는 진화하는 자율주행 기술과 함께 이를 제도적으로 정착할 수 있는 법률의 방향을 영국과 독일의 자율주행자동차 관련 법령을 살펴봄으로써 부족하지만 우리나라의 자율주행자동차의 방향을 찾고자 하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,자율주행자동차의 등장에 따른 배상책임과 증명책임의 과제 = A Study on the Liability for Damages and the Burden of Proof Relating the Autonomous Car,"autonomous car,technical standard,liability for damage,burden of proof,product liability,자율주행자동차,국제기술표준,배상책임,증명책임,제조물책임,구상권","자율주행자동차 시대의 도래는 임박한 확정적 미래로서 현행 법제에 대한 새로운 도전이 된다. 자동차에 관련된 전통적인 논의는 사고시의 책임 문제이다. 자율주행자동차가 사고율을 낮춘다는 것은 공인된 인식이라 할 수 있겠지만, 사고가 나지 않는 것은 아니며 실제로 발생하기도 했다. 이에 대한 입법적 대비가 충분히 되어 있지 않은 상황이라 할 수 있다. 그러므로 아직은 현행법의 영역에서 해결되어야 한다. 이에 대하여 사고의 발생이 자율주행시스템이 자동차를 제어하는 상황에서인지 아니면 운전자가 주행을 장악하고 있던 때인지에 따라 배상책임을 달리 보아야 한다는 입장에 대하여는 타당하지 않음을 살폈다. 결국은 자동차손배법상 운행자인 자동차보유자가 책임을 진다고 해석해야 한다. 준무과실책임으로 피해를 배상하게 되는 자동차보유자나 보험사등은 자율주행자동차의 결함을 원인으로 들어 제조사에 구상권을 행사할 수 있는지가 문제될 것이며, 이는 이론상으로도 그리고 최근의 입법으로 당연히 행사할 수 있다. 이때 적용될 제조물 책임법은 피해자의 입증 정도를 경감시켜 주는 제3조의2와 제조사의 면책 요건을 규정하는 제4조를 둔다. 여기서 제4조의 제1항 2호에서 입증을 요구하는 “당시의 과학?기술 수준으로는 결함의 존재를 발견할 수 없었다는 사실”에 대해 관련 국제표준과 관련하여 논의하면서 짚어보았다. 그리고 자율주행자동차에 관하여는 핵심 분야에서 국제표준이 없다는 문제점도 지적하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,자율주행자동차 사고의 법적 책임 = Legal Responsibility of A utonomous Vehicle A ccident,"Autonomous Vehicles,Driverless Cars,Artificial Intelligence (AI),Robot,Automated Driving System (ADS),Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS),자율주행자동차,운전자 없는 자동차,인공지능,로봇,자동 운전 장치,첨단 운전자 보조시스템","자율주행자동차란 “운전자 또는 승객의 조작 없이 자동차 스스로 운행이 가능한 자동차”를 말한다. 현재 개발되는 자율주행차는 대체로 자동차 자체에 인공지능(AI)의 자동 운전 장치(ADS)가 탑재되는 형태이다. ADS는 ‘첨단 운전자 보조시스템(ADAS)’를 통합한 자체의 시스템과 정보에만 의존하는 개별적 ‘내재적’ 방식을 지나 이미 다른 차량이나 인프라스트럭처 등과 상호 정보를 교환하고 스스로 교통 환경을 판단하는 방식으로 진화하고 있다. 이와 같이 자율주행자동차의 모든 운전은 ADS에 의해 관리될 수 있다.
자율주행차는 비자율주행차의 치명적 충돌사고율을 획기적으로 감소시키는 등 그 안전성이 높이 평가된다.
자율주행차에 의한 사고의 원인으로는 ADS 장치와 차량의 장치 및 부품의 기계적 결함, 내재적 소프트웨어 결함, 통신 시스템 상 오류 정보 제공, 자율주행 환경을 위한 시설의고장, 예상하기 어려운 자연재해 등과 돌발상황, 시스템에 대한 해킹 등을 예상할 수 있다.
문제는 이상과 같이 복잡한 자율주행차관련 사고 원인을 밝혀내는 것이 매우 어렵고 또한그 원인들이 중복되어 사고가 발생할 수 있다는 점이다.
자율주행차에 의한 교통법규 위반은 자율주행기술이 적용되도록 한 사람, 조정자를 운전자로 간주하여 그 책임을 부담시킬 수 있을 것이다. 그러나 인간 운전자를 전제로 하는사고 등에 대한 형사책임은 (완전) 자율주행차의 경우에는 성립하기 어렵고 심지어 음주운전도 형사 처벌의 대상이 되기 어렵다. 그렇다고 해서 특별법을 제정하여 자율주행차의 탑승자나 특정인을 “운전자”로 의제하자는 주장은 형사법의 근본에 반할 뿐만 아니라 왜 운전, 즉 능동적 운전 행위를 하지 않은 사람을 꼭 처벌해야 하는가라는 의문에서 타당하지않다. 또한 책임 부과 대상을 지정하기 위해 기술발전을 무시한 채 운전자 제어 전환 방식으로 자율주행자동차를 법제화하는 것도 타당하지 않다.
향후 자율주행차관련 사고에서는 종래의 운전자에 대한 형사책임이 상당부분 시스템 관리자에 대한 책임으로 전환될 것이고 민사책임도 운전자의 과실 책임에서 제조물 책임과시스템 관리자에 대한 책임 등으로 대체될 것으로 보인다.
이와 같은 생각을 바탕으로 하여 한국의 자율주행차관련 법체계를 수립하기 위해서는①외국의 새로운 입법례에 대한 계속적 탐색, ②자율주행차 사고 관련 사례와 더불어 과거무인 교통수단에 의한 사고 사례의 처리 결과에 대한 연구, ③자동차 제조물 책임 및 제작결함(리콜) 사례 연구, ④산업혁명과 산업화를 거치면서 다양한 경험과 사례를 통해 축적된영국과 미국의 불법행위 보통법(Common Law)에 대한 연구 등으로 현실과 괴리되지 않는기본 자료를 충분히 확보하여야 한다.
특히 자율주행차 시대로의 진입 이전에 안전 및 인증관련해서 자율주행차 특성을 반영하고, 글로벌 기준에 합당하고 ADS의 기술력 차이에 따른 차량의 혼주행을 막기 위한 새로운 자율주행차 안전기준의 수립과 시행이 필요하다. 특히 자율주행차의 인증이나 운행허가와 관련하여 한 가지 ADAS의 작동이 실패하는 경우에도 다른 ADAS의 작동에 보완(backup) 시스템이 확보되어야 한다. 또한 시스템 알고리듬 설계 단계에서부터 인간 존엄및 안전 우선, 즉 이른바 로봇 3원칙과 형법상의 긴급피난의 ‘차악(次惡)의 선택’ 법리가적용되어 변화 없이 유지되도록 국가의 입법 ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

본고에서는 자율주행자동차 도입을 위한 시스템적, 사회적, 법·제도적 관점에서 주요 논점을 살펴보았다. 우선, 자율주행에 필요한 요소는 다양한 정보일 것이다. 정보교환은 자율주행자동차와 다양한 기기 간에 이루어지나 정보의 교환 그 자체로 보안상의 취약성을 갖고 있다. 이러한 보안상의 문제에 대응하기 위하여 소프트웨어의 지속적인 업데이트에 의한 안전 확보와 소프트웨어의 품질과 보안의 개선이 가능한 오픈소스 소프트웨어의 도입이 필요하다. 둘째, 보조운전 지원 개념과 인간의 개입을 전제로 하지 않는 자율주행자동차 개념이 교차하는 레벨 3단계의 자율주행자동차에 대한 인간의 주행능력과 운전오류에 대해 논의하였다. 선행 연구는 부족하지만 “운전 전환 시기의 재량과 전환 이후 인간의 운전 대응”을 위한 자동차 제조사와 인공지능·인간공학·뇌과학 전문가·법률가 등에 의한 검증을 거친 “표준화”의 필요성을 강조하였다. 셋째, 자율주행의 운행 알고리즘은 상호간의 교통 행동에 대응하며 위험을 인지하고 회피하는 방향으로 구현될 필요가 있다. 또한, 교통 규칙의 ‘즉시 창발성’에 주목한 알고리즘의 기초 마련이 자율주행시스템에 필요하고, 향후 자율주행자동차에 어떠한 기능을 요구할 것인지, 그러한 기능을 갖췄을 경우 자동차 제조사, 알고리즘 설계자, 자율주행자동차의 이용자, 이해 관계자 사이의 책임 분배에 대한 기준이 필요하다. 따라서 자율주행과 관련된 컴퓨터 과학과 인공지능, 인문과학, 법학 등의 학제적 관점에서 더욱 연구를 도모해 나갈 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

첫째 자동차보험 약관의 자동차 시세하락손해 관련 조항은 보험자의 책임 한도액을 정한 것이 아니라 보험금 지급기준에 불과하여 보험회사가 보상하여야 할 손해액을 산정하면서 법원이 약관조항에서정한 지급기준에 구속될 것은 아니라고 판시하면서 자동차보험약관상 시세하락손해 보상대상에 해당하지 않는 경우에도 법원 판결에 의해 시세하락손해를 인정할 수 있다.
둘째 업무용 자동차종합보험계약의 관용차 면책약관은 군인 등의 피해자가 다른 법령에 의하여 보상을 지급받을 수 있어 국가나 지방자치단체가 국가배상법 제2조 제1항 단서에 따라 손해배상책임을부담하지 않는 경우에 한하여 적용되는 것이다.
셋째 피해자의 일실수입 산정시 기왕증 기여도를 반영했다면 기왕ㆍ향후치료비를 산정할 때에도(나아가 전 손해액에 대해서도) 이를 반영해야 하고 단순히 책임제한사유로 고려하는데 그쳐서는 안된다.
넷째 군의관인 정형외과 전문의의 전역 이후 일실수입산정 기준을 고용형태별 근로실태조사보고서의 ‘보건ㆍ사회복지 및 종교 관련직’으로 적용한 것은 합리성과 객관성을 갖추지 못한 것이고 정형외과 전문의 자격을 갖춘 봉직의 또는 개업의의 소득을 기준으로 합리적이고 개연성 있는 예상소득을산정해야 한다.

자율주행자동차가 주행 중 사고가 발생한 경우 사고에 대한 민ㆍ형사 책임을 누가 질 것인가는 매우 복잡한 문제다. 자율주행자동차 주행에 관여하는 주체가 다양하기 때문이다. 운전자와 자동차 제조회사 뿐만 아니라 시스템 운영체제(OS)와 소프트웨어(SW) 업체, 통신사, 도로정보 제공 업체 등 사고 원인이 될 수 있는 주체가 광범위하기 때문이다. 사고책임을 묻기 위해서는 정확한 사고원인규명이 선결되어야 한다.
자율주행자동차 사고를 해결하기 위해서는 현재 항공기나 철도사고시 적용되는 「항공철도 사고조사에 관한 법률」처럼 별도의 입법안이 마련될 필요가 있다. 또한 클라우드 시스템을 구축하여 모든 주행정보를 국가가 통합관리하고, 자율주행자동차 사고발생시 이를 활용하는 방안이 필요하다. 사고발생시 활용될 수 있는 자료들을 의무적으로 클라우드 시스템에 전송ㆍ저장하도록 법적 의무 규정을 마련해야할 것이며, 항공기와 같은 블랙박스 설치 등도 의무화해야 한다. 나아가 전문사고를 위한 전문조직을 신설하고, 융복합적 사고를 가진 사고조사 전문인력을 양성해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,자동차산업의 밸류 체인(Value Chain) 분석: 광주광역시의 사례 = An Analysis on Value Chain of Automobile Industry in Gwangju,"Automobile Industry,Value Chain,Regional Input-Output Table,Gwangju City,자동차산업,밸류 체인,지역산업연관표,광주광역시","본 논문은  지역산업연관표를 이용하여 광주광역시 자동차산업이 타 지역 관련 산업과 연계된 밸류 체인(value chain)을 구조적으로 분석하였다. 분석 결과를 보면, 광주 자동차산업은 지역경제에 매우 큰 영향을 미치고 있지만 지역산업의 의존성이 크기 때문에 다른 지역으로의 수요 창출과 산업구조의 다변화가 요구된다. 특히 부가가치 기준으로 자기 지역의 최종수요에 상당히 의존하고 있어, 다른 지역으로의 수요를 다변화시킬 필요가 있다. 
이러한 점에서 광주 자동차산업은 최종수요의 소비 측면에서는 자동차수리업 등의 개인서비스부문과의 연계, 투자 측면에서는 연구개발 등의 사업서비스부문과의 연계, 수출 측면에서는 자동차부품산업과 관련된 제조업부문과의 연계 육성 정책이 필요하다. 마지막으로 광주 자동차산업은 부가가치 창출에 비해 취업 창출 비율이 상대적으로 낮기 때문에, 고용창출을 위한 전략적인 정책이 필요하다. 최근 성사된 ‘광주형 일자리’에 따르면, 자동차산업은 고용창출에 중요한 전략적 전환점이 될 수 있다. 이와 더불어 일반적으로 취업계수가 높은 자동차 관련 서비스산업과의 육성 정책도 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,자동차사고와 과실비율산정에 관한 일본의 최근 논의 = The Recent Discussions on Responsibility for Car Compensation and Estimation of Fault Ration in Japan,"자동차보험, 자동차배상책임보험, 과실비율, 과실상계, Knock for Knock 협정, car insurance, automobile third party liability insurance, fault ratio, comparative negligence, Knock for Knock agreement","자동차사고로 인해 상대방에게 손해를 입힌 경우 그 손해에 대해 배상을 해야 한다. 그런데 자동차사고의 경우 그 특성상 쌍방 모두에게 잘못이 있는 경우가 적지 않으며, 당사자간 책임을 어떻게 분배할 것인가가 문제가 된다. 이 경우 손해배상의 책임과 그 배상액을 산정함에 있어 피해자의 책임을 함께 고려하게 된다. 즉 피해자가 손해의 발생 및 확대에 책임이 있는 경우 그 손해배상액을 감액하는 것이 일반적인데, 이를 ‘과실상계’라고 한다.
과실상계제도는 일반적인 채무불이행이나 불법행위의 경우에도 모두 적용되고 있으며, 그 타당성이 인정되고 있다. 그러나 자동차간 사고의 경우 과실상계와 관련하여 특별한 문제가 제기되고 있다. 대표적인 예로 고가의 자동차와 저가의 자동차가 충돌한 사고의 경우, 저가 자동차 운전자의 경우 자신의 과실이 적음에도 불구하고 더 많은 손해배상을 하는 경우가 발생하기 때문이다. 현행 민법상 손해배상제도의 경우 손해 총액을 모두 고려한 후, 당사자 간 과실비율을 고려하여 과실상계를 하고 있으며, 이 경우 목적물의 가액에 따라 손해배상금액이 달라지기 때문이다. 최근 고가의 외제차가 증가하고 있는 현실을 고려할 때 이러한 문제는 일상적으로 발생가능성이 있다. 이에 따라 자동차사고와 관련한 과실상계의 문제점을 지적하는 견해들도 적지 않다.
이러한 문제의 해결방안으로서 검토할 수 있는 것이 일본에서 도입이 논의되고 있는 Knock for Knock 협정이라고 생각된다. 동 제도를 도입하는 경우 고가차량의 운전자는 더 많은 보험료를 납입하고 사고 발생시 수리를 보장받게 되는 것이고, 저가차량의 운전자는 더 적은 보험료를 납입하고 그 범위에서 수리를 보장받게 된다. 한편, 대인손해가 발생하는 경우에는 현행과 같이 가해자가 피해자에게 충분한 보상을 해야 한다. 즉, 고가차량과 저가차량의 사고시 발생하는 불합리한 점을 개선할 수 있는 방안이 될 수 있을 것으로 생각된다. 물론 동 제도를 도입하기 위해서는 보다 구체적인 검토가 필요하며, 향후 보다 심도깊은 논의가 이루어질 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  본 연구의 목적은 이러한 자동차기술의 급격한 변화에 따른 자동차디자인에서의 전략이 향후에 어떤 변화를 맞게 될지를 살펴서, 보다 거시적인 차량개발전략 수립 방법으로써의 디자인융합전략에 대한 시사점을 찾는 것이다. 따라서 본 논문은 향후의 자동차산업의 변화에 의한 디자인 융합전략을 고찰하였다.
  본 연구의 결과 및 내용은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 서비스 개념의 강화로 완성차 제조사 브랜드보다는 이동이나 공유 서비스 제공 회사가 어디인가가 오히려 중요해질 것으로 보인다. 둘째, 다른 한편으로는 개인소유를 중시하는 차량의 개발에서는 오히려 개별 차량의 스타일 특성이나 기능적 차별성을 강조하는 상반된 디자인 전략이 유효할 것으로 보인다. 이는 현재의 고급 브랜드 전략과 배치되는 현상으로 보인다.
  이러한 연구 결과를 바탕으로 향후에 모빌리티 서비스나 차량공유 서비스가 확대되고 진전됨에 따라, 서비스 제공 형태에 따른 디자인 차별화 방법은 현재의 대중 브랜드와 프리미엄 브랜드에서 볼 수 있는 것과는 오히려 상반된 방향으로 진전될 수 있다는 결론을 얻을 수 있었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  이 글은 크게 두 부분으로 구성되어 작성되었다.
  글의 전반부에는 금번의 사태와 관련되는 현행 법제를 분석하는 작업에 집중하였다. 모법이라고 할 수 있는 자동차관리법상의 제 규정들과 제조물에 대한 손해배상의 내용을 담고 있는 제조물 책임법에 대한 분석이 그것이다. 자동차에 대한 안전기준을 설정하고 그 기준에 부합함을 자동차제작자가 스스로 인증하는 현행 자동차관리제도의 구조에 대한 설명과 더불어 결함자동차에 대한 ‘리콜’관련 규정, 그리고 소위 ‘레몬법’이라고 칭해지는 신차에 대한 ‘교환·환불’관련 규정에 대한 분석 등을 함께 담았다. 뒤이어 최근 징벌적 손해배상의 내용을 신설한 바 있는 제조물 책임법의 개정취지와 그 적용을 위한 구체적 요건들을 분석하였다.
  이러한 분석을 기반으로 하여 글의 후반부에서는, 현행의 제도가 가지고 있는 한계에 대하여 몇 가지의 쟁점으로 나누어 검토를 진행하였다. 먼저 현행 법률상 가장 큰 오류라고 할 수 있는 ‘하자와 결함’에 대한 혼용에 대하여 검토하였다. 이로 인한 부정합이 결국 입법상의 흠결로 이어진다는 것을 논리적으로 검증함으로써 명시적인 정의규정의 필요성을 강조하였다. 다음으로는 현행 입법이 가지고 있는 체제 구성상의 혼란에 대하여 검토하였다. 행정목적의 법률에다 소비자보호법제인 ‘레몬법’을 첨가하고 있는 현행의 상태에다, 다시금 손해배상법제에 해당하는 징벌적 손해배상제도를 신설하고자 하는 현재의 개정담론이 가지는 난점을 짚어보았다. 마지막으로 무력한 행정력에 대한 검토를 진행하였다. 현행의 ‘자기인증’제도는 본래 충분한 사후검증을 전제로 시행하는 제도인데도 불구하고, 열악한 조직과 부족한 예산으로 사실상 무력한 상태에 빠져있는 우리의 현실을 적시하였다. 이러한 무력이 결국 입법의 불비에서 비롯되었음을 확인하고, 벌칙규정을 강화하기에 급급한 주먹구구식 입법이 결코 해결책이 될 수 없음을 밝혔다.
  이러한 검토를 통하여 필자는 현재 진행되고 있는 개정담론에 대하여, 몇몇 조문의 신설을 통한 단순 개정이 아니라 이미 불비와 혼란의 상태에 빠져있는 현행 자동차관리법제 전반을 근본적으로 손보아야 한다는 것을 주장하였다.

The transferred heat causes deformation of lamp materials when it exceeds the heat-resistance limits. To reduce the effort from trial and error by failing the heat-resistance test after designing and producing lamps, using a simulation program is necessary at the design stage. A new in-house heat-resistance prediction program with less errors is going to be developed, which covers conduction, convection and radiation based on experiments. The experimental facility is designed, according to variables, such as bulb powers, heat-resistant distance, boundary conditions, etc. Key parameters were set to select and perform experimental cases. The surface average temperatures were calculated, and the temperature distribution patterns of each surface were found. As a result of the experiment, the temperature distribution of all data values was different at temperature, but the shape was very similar. This shows similar heat transfer patterns throughout the data. In the case of forced convection, the temperature distribution was lower depending on the atmosphere temperature, bulb distance, and box size compared to the natural convection.

2018,지자체 교통부문 미세먼지 관리방안 = 서울시 자동차 친환경등급제를 중심으로,,"In recent years, there have been increasing concerns on the management of particulate matter (PM) in Seoul. The city’s annual mean concentration of PM2.5 (of which diameter is less than 2.5 μm) is 2.5 times higher than the level outlined by the WHO’s guideline. In addition, premature deaths which have been attributed to PM2.5 was 1,762 people in 2015. Urban access regulation is one of the effective policy measures that have been put in place to address air pollution. Although Seoul has been operating the Low Emission Zone (designated areas where the most polluting vehicles are regulated) since 2010, the program’s impact on urban air pollution is limited because it covers only heavy-duty, diesel-powered, freight vehicles. For this reason, we propose a new urban access regulation in Seoul. The proposed regulation covers all kinds of cars (including passenger cars, gasoline/LPG cars, light-duty cars, foreign cars), of which emission level is 5 or more according to the national air quality certificate (ROK Ministry of Environment). In addition, detailed policy designs including designated areas, exceptions, enforcement systems, penalties, incentives, and long-term plans have also been proposed conducted on the issue, it was established that a majority of the general public support the scheme (77% of respondents agree) and many citizens (more than half) require more stringent application of the scheme.

  방송자동차는 전력이 부족한 농촌 지역을 순회하면서 주로 국책선전과 과학문명에 대한 인식을 주민들에게 전달하고자 했다. 그러나 주민들은 그보다는 방송 동원의 유인책으로 채택되었던 음악이나 전통곡예, 영화, 만화 등 문화오락에 더욱 집중하는 반응을 보였다. 이로부터 근대 오락문화에 대한 소비 주체의 욕망을 읽을 수 있었다. 다시 말하면 방송자동차는 과학과 문명의 상징으로서 지역 주민들에게 근대 미디어 문화에 대한 인식을 심어줌과 동시에 그에 대한 소비 주체로서의 욕망을 일깨워주었다. 따라서 방송자동차의 가시적인 효과는 그가 지닌 미디어의 근대성(과학성, 오락성)을 통해 찾아볼 수 있다. 반면 방송 주체가 의도했던 방송자동차의 프로파간다성이 얼마간의 효과를 거두었는지는 미지수다. 다만 이동방송을 통해 드러난 국책선전에 대한 무반응 내지는 외면의 태도로부터 볼 때 이동방송의 프로파간다성이 의도대로 순조롭게 수행되지 못했을 것으로 추정된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  자율주행자동차 사고유형으로는 운전자(소유자)의 고의 · 과실에 의한 사고, 차량의 기계적 결함에 의한 사고, 소프트웨어 오작동에 의한 사고, 오류정보에 의한 사고, 외부해킹에 의한 사고 등 5가지 유형의 사고를 예상해 볼 수 있다. 자율주행자동차가 주행 중 사고가 발생하였을 경우 법적 책임의 문제는 기존의 자동차사고와는 다른 새로운 패러다임을 요구하고 있다. 다양한 법률적 문제 중에서 가장 해결이 쉽지 않은 문제가 형사법적인 문제이다.
  자율주행자동차 사고발생시 법적 책임의 귀속에 관한 문제는 과학의 문제가 아니다. 규범의 문제이며, 특히 형사책임에 있어서는 형법의 기본이념인 책임주의와의 관계에서 해결해야 한다. 자율주행모드 레벨 1단계에서 3단계까지는 운전자가 운행의 주체가 되어 자동차를 운행하기 때문에 사고가 발생한 경우에는 사고책임을 현행과 같이 운전자에게 귀속시킬 수 있다. 그러나 레벨 4단계에서는 자율주행자동차는 운전자의 개념이 존재하지 않으며, 탑승자는 승객에 불과하다. 운행에 대한 주의의무가 존재하지 않은 탑승자에게 기존의 법리대로 형사상 책임을 귀속시킬 수는 없다.
  본 논문에서는 자율주행자동차의 개념과 기술현황을 살펴본 후, 자율주행자동차가 상용화 되었을 경우 발생할 수 있는 사고유형을 탐색적으로 연구하였다. 자율주행자동차의 레벨 단계별 형사책임에 대해 분석한 후, 각각의 형사법적 쟁점에 대해 살펴보았다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EU는 2008년에 ‘2020 기후·에너지 패키지(2020 Climate and Energy Package)’를 채택하여, 2020년까지 1990년 대비 온실가스 배출 20% 감축, 최종에너지 소비에서 재생에너지 비중 20%로 확대, 에너지 효율 20% 증대 등 3가지 ‘20-20-20 목표’를 설정하였다. EU는 1990년 대비 20% 온실가스 감축을 2020년까지 달성한다는 목표를 2014년에 이미 달성하였다.
EU에서 에너지산업과 산업-건설분야의 온실가스 배출은 큰폭으로 감소하였다. 그러나 운송분야에서 온실가스 배출은 1990년부터 2010년까지 증가추세에 있었다. 운송분야는 EU에서 에너지산업분야 다음으로 온실가스를 많이 배출하고 있다.
이에 따라서 EU회원국은 온실가스 배출을 감축시키려는 노력을 지속하고 있다. 그러나 EU회원국은 운송분야 온실가스 배출을 위한 친환경 모빌리티 정책에서 각기 다른 정책을 실시하고 있다.
체코는 EU 자동차 생산의 중심으로 부상하였다. 그러나 전기자동차 등록대수는 EU회원국에서 낮은 편이며, 체코정부는 2030년까지 25만대의 전기자동차 운영을 목표로 하고 있으며, 2030년 이후에 40만대의 전기자동차 운영을 목표로 설정하였다. 또한 체코정부는 기술중립원칙(Principle of Technological Neutrality)을 적용하여 순수전기자동차(EV)뿐만아니라 플러그인-하이브리드자동차와 압축천연가스 자동차 등을 운송분야 온실가스 배출감축에서 활용하려고 하고 있다. 반면에 네덜란드의 경우는 2030년부터 신규자동차 등록에서 탄소배출이 전혀 없는 자동차만 허용하는 정책을 실시하면서 순수전기자동차(Fully electric vehicles)만 자동차 구입보조금을 지급하고 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up until now, typical public charging station has 2~3 chargers to support charging needs of the Ev users. As the EV become more popular, a newly noticed problems such as either charger hopping or long waiting become eminent. In order to address this new but, a certain issue, large scale charging theme park concept which has more than 30 chargers is proposed. Furthermore, in order to maximize its effectiveness, a strategic approach to select the close-to-ideal locations for the charging them park is introduced as well. In this study, Jeju Island, which has many electric vehicle in Korea, is selected as an analysis model. We propose an algorithm for the assignment of weighting factors according to the location of tourist attractions, convenient supporting facilities and the density of population. The estimated locations are validated using actual charger usage data collected over time in Jeju island. The proposed strategy to identify appropriate location for large scale charging theme parks can be used in other tourist heavy island or even for small countries. If the algorithm is enhanced.

The task types can involve replacing panels with a large number of minor contacts and heavy traffic accident modes with new panels or affixing a new panel to the existing one. In general, if a vehicle got involved in a traffic accident or is repaired for various reasons, a repair stamp must be attached thereto based on the new vehicle""s paintwork. Unlike the new-vehicle painting process, the vehicle repair painting process is highly dependent on the operator’s painting skills(i.e., performance, purpose, level, attitude, etc.) due to the nature of the painting task. In particular, vehicle repair painting should be carried out using coating structures such as that shown in Fig. 1 when repairing or changing a door panel. Due to the absence of a standardized vehicle repair painting manual, however, the number of work methods being employed in the 6,000 maintenance plants across the country(comprehensive, 1, 2, and 3) varies widely. To ensure that customers’ vehicles receive uniform repair painting, a standardized vehicle repair painting manual should be used. As such, this study produced a standardized vehicle repair painting manual for the change or repair of the rear door panels in vehicle repair plants. It is hoped that such standardized vehicle repair painting manual will guide the vehicle repair painting process henceforth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

자동차용 반도체는 차량용 전자 컨트롤 장치 중 핵심 부품으로 소비자들에게 안정성, 연료 사용의 효율성, 운전의 안정감을 제공하기 위해 사용되고 있다. 자동차용 반도체는 가솔린엔진, 디젤 엔진, 전기 모터를 컨트롤하는 기술, 헤드업 디스플레이, 차선 유지 시스템 등 많은 부분에 적용되고 있다. 이와 같이 반도체는 자동차를 구성하는 거의 모든 전자 컨트롤 장치에 적용되고 있으며 기계적인 장치를 단순히 조합한 이상의 효과를 만들어 내고 있다. 
자동차용 반도체는 10년 이상의 자동차 사용 기간을 고려하여 높은 신뢰성, 내구성, 장기공급 등의 특성을 요구하고 있다. 자동차용 반도체의 신뢰성은 자동차의 안전성과 직접적으로 연결되기 때문이다. 반도체업계에서는 JEDEC과 AEC 등의 산업 표준 규격을 이용하여 자동차용 반도체의 신뢰성을 평가하고 있다. 또한 자동차 산업에서 표준으로 제시한 신뢰성 실험 방법과 그 결과를 이용하여 개발 초기 단계 및 제품 양산 초기 단계에서 제품의 수명을 예측 하고 있다. 하지만 고객의 다양한 사용 조건 및 사용 시간 등 여러 변수들에 의해 발생되는 불량률을 예측하는 데는 한계가 있다. 이러한 한계점을 극복하기 위하여 학계와 산업계에서 많은 연구가 있어왔다. 그 중 데이터 마이닝 기법을 이용한 연구가 다수의 반도체 분야에서 진행되고 있지만, 아직 자동 차용 반도체에 대한 적용 및 연구는 미비한 상태이다.

그런데, 새롭게 등장하고 있는 자율주행차량에서는 “자동차”의 운전을 인간이 아니라 하드웨어와 소프트웨어의 총합체인 “자율주행시스템”(ADS : automated driving system)이 담당하게 된다. 이러한 운전작업의 담당주체의 변화는 인간 운전자의 운전행위를 규제하기 위해 발전한 도로교통법상 규제체제가 “인간”이 아니라 “자율주행시스템” 즉 ADS 의 규제를 위한 것으로 완전히 전환될 수 있음을 의미한다. 동시에, 자동차의 기계적 안전성확보를 위한 자동차관리법상 규제체제가 운전작업을 담당하는 자율주행시스템 즉 ADS 규제에 대해서도 확장·적용될 수 있음을 의미한다.
이 글에서는 먼저 호주 국립교통위원회가 제안하고 영국도 채택할 것으로 예상되는 새로운 방안, 즉 ADS를 대신해 운전의 의무와 책임을 지는 주체인 ADS Entity, 소위 ADSE 개념에 대해 살펴본다. 그 다음 ADSE 개념과 유사하나 약간 차이가 있는 미국의 ADP (automated driving provider) 개념에 대해 살펴본다. ADP 개념은 올해 2019년 7월 미국 통일주법위원회가 승인한 “차량의 자율운행에 관한 통일법”(Uniform Automated Operation of Vehicles Act)에 채용되었는데, 미국의 많은 주에서 이 통일법을 채택할 것으로 예상된다. 다음으로 비엔나협약 혹은 제네바협약과 같은 교통법규의 국제적정합성에 대해 살펴본다. 미국과 영국 등의 국제적 영향력을 생각하면 이러한 ADSE 혹은 ADP 개념은 조만간 도로교통에 관한 비엔나협약이나 제네바협약에 반영될 것으로 예상되는데, 이러한 협약의 개정을 통해 제네바협약 비준국인 우리나라가 구속되는 경우, 우리나라의 입법에 어떠한 영향을 미칠 것인가를 분석해 보았다. 결론적으로 대세가 될 것으로 예상되는 ADSE 개념을 미리 연구해 우리 입법에 반영할 필요가 있어 보인다. 먼저, 자동차관리법에 ADS의 개념 및 ADS 안전기준의 개념을 도입하고, ADS 안전기준에 따라 자기인증을 실행하는 주체인 ADSE 개념을 도입해야 한다. 다음으로 도로교통법상 조치 사항으로 자율주행차의 운행을 ADS가 담당하는 경우 그에 대해 책임을 지는 주체로서 ADSE 개념을 도입하고, 교통규칙에 인간운전자를 전제로 한 규정 외에 ADS 운전을 전제한 규정들을 도입해야 한다. 마지막으로 자배법상 피해자보호를 위한 책임보험을 ADSE가 들도록 할 것인지 혹은 현행과 같이 보유자가 들도록 할 것인지 여부를 살펴보아야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,새 모빌리티 패러다임과 모빌리티 텍스트 연구 방법의 모색 = New Mobilities Paradigm and Mobility-Based Textual Research Method,"존 어리,새 모빌리티 패러다임,텍스트 연구,자동차 모빌리티,형식의 모빌리티,모빌리티의 재현,John Urry,new mobilities Paradigm,textual studies,automobility,mobilities of form,representation of mobility","이 글의 목적은 피터 메리만과 린 피어스가 편집한 <모빌리티와 인문학(Mobilities and the Humanities)>을 중심으로 ‘새 모빌리티 패러다임’과 그에 기초한 영상 및 문학 텍스트의 연구 사례들을 살펴보고, 그것들이 텍스트 연구 방법으로서 갖는 의의를 검토함으로써 모빌리티 텍스트 연구 방법을 모색하는 데 있다.
<모빌리티와 인문학>은 ‘인문학’이라는 제목과 달리 대부분 문학 및 영상 텍스트와 그 미학을 다루는 논문들로 구성되어 있다. 이 글은 이 책에 실린 논문들을 자동차 모빌리티 시스템에 집중하는 논문들과 그렇지 않은 논문들로 구분해서 다룬다. 자동차 시스템은 오늘날 모빌리티를 상징적으로 보여주는 기계로서 과거 철도가 근대 초기 보유했던 것만큼 커다란 사회적·문화적 의의를 지니고 있기 때문이다. 우선, 자동차 모빌리티에 초점을 맞추는 논문들은 주로 모빌리티 시스템과 영상·문학 텍스트의 공진화 양상을 탐구한다. 여기서는 자동차 모빌리티 시스템과 로드무비 장르의 내적 상호작용, 일종의 텍스트로서 미디어화된 자동차 모빌리티, 여행소설과 ‘마비된 모빌리티’의 텍스트적 재현, 개별 자동차 여행의 특이성과 ‘기술적 무의식’ 등의 문제를 다룬다. 그 외의 논문들은 모빌리티와 예술 형식의 관계를 중심으로 형식의 모빌리티 또는 모빌리티의 재현 문제를 탐구한다. ‘형식의 모빌리티’ 또는 ‘이동하는 예술 형식’, 리얼리즘적 재현을 통한 이동하는 세계에서의 ‘느린 장소 감각’(애착감, 친근감) 형성, 문학 텍스트의 ‘소급적 특징’에 기초한 허구적 서사의 (재)독해와 ‘대안 정치’의 가능성, 생활 글쓰기(일기)에 기록된 개별 여행자의 도시 모빌리티 경험 등에 대해 논의한다.
<모빌리티와 인문학>의 의의는 크게 두 가지다. 첫째, 그 동안 텍스트 연구에서 충분히 다루어지 않았던 자동차 모빌리티에 주목하게 해준다는 점이다. 둘째, 새 모빌리티 패러다임의 관점에서 텍스트의 미학에 관한 새로운 논의를 가능하게 해준다는 점이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,국내발생 ASR의 자원화를 위한 선별시스템 개발,"폐자동차, ASR, 재활용, 단위 선별기술, 선별시스템","지구 부존자원의 채굴량 한계, 산업규모의 증가 등으로 인해 원료 자원의 수요에 비해 공급량 부족 현상이 발생할 것으로 예상됨에 따라 이미 사용수명이 다한 폐기물로부터 유효한 자원을 회수하는 재활용 이슈가 부각되고 있다. 특히, 근대화된 도시로부터 발생하는 폐기물은 기하급수적으로 증가하고 있으며, 이 중 자동차의 경우 전기?전자제품과 더불어 주요 대체자원으로서 중요성이 점점 증가하고 있는 실정이다. 이처럼 대체자원의 활용 및 환경오염 방지 전략의 일환으로 1998년 독일의 주요 산업체들은 자발적으로 철 및 비철금속이 75% 이상 함유된 폐 자동차(ELV : End-of-Life Vehicle, 이하 ELV & 폐 자동차)의 재활용처리규정을 제정하고 실행하였으며, 이러한 기본 규정을 바탕으로 EU 위원회에서 2000년 EU 폐차처리규정(EU ELV Regulation)을 발효시킨 점 등은 대표적인 실례라고 할 수 있다. 폐자동차의 재활용 공정을 살펴보면, 최초 해체업자에게 인도되어 재활용할 수 있는 부품 및 폐유, 폐타이어나 폐배터리 등을 분리하여 적정한 처리를 하고, 남은 body 등은 슈레더 업체에 인도된다. 슈레더 사업자는 body, 유리, 시트 등을 포함하고 있는 폐차를 파쇄/분별하여 철, 비철금속 등 재이용할 수 있는 금속 스크랩을 회수한다. 유가금속을 회수하기 위한 슈레더 공정을 거치고 나면, 재이용이 곤란한 합성수지, 유리, 고무 등의 잔재물이 남는데 이러한 잔재물을 ASR(Automobile Shredder Residue)이라 한다. 자동차 중량의 25%를 차지하는 ASR은 금속에 비해 재활용률이 낮고 관련 기술이나 인프라가 구축되어 있지 않아 대부분 소각이나 매립에 의하여 처리되고 있다. 소각하여 감용화 하는 것이 가능한 고체 산업폐기물은 소각하여 매립하는 것이 일반적이지만, ASR의 소각이나 매립은 폐자동차의 재활용율 감소와 매립지의 부족, 환경오염 문제 등을 야기하고 있어 재활용을 위한 기술개발이 필요한 실정이다. 본 연구에서는 ASR 재활용률 80% 달성을 위하여 단위 선별기술이 융합된 복합선별시스템을 개발하였다. 재활용에 필수적인 물질수지 분석을 위하여 ASR을 이루는 물질의 구성비를 바탕으로 기존 단위 공정 연구결과에 따른 예상 회수율을 적용하였다. 그리고 물질항목 당 예상되는 재활용률을 계산하고 이를 합산하여 총 재활용률을 확인하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,로보택시(robo-taxi) 상용화 시 예상되는 보험 이슈 = Insurance Issues for Commercialization of Robo-Taxi,"Robo-taxi,Car Insurance,Guarantee of Automobile Accident Compensation Act,Product Liability,Liability of Car Accident,로보택시,자동차보험,자동차손해배상보장법,제조물책임법,손해배상책임","자율주행자동차의 상용화는 교통, 물류, 보험 등 각 분야에서 많은 구조적 변화를 예고하고 있다. 자율주행자동차의 상용화와 관련하여 기존의 승차공유서비스 업체뿐만 아니라 자율주행기술을 연구 중인 IT기업들도 적극적으로 준비하고 있다. 초기 시장의 자율주행택시 상용화 이후 안정성이 충분히 검토된 후에는 완전자율주행택시인 로보택시(robo-taxi)가 상용화 될 것으로 예상된다. 향후 로보택시가 승차공유 서비스에 활용되면 이동비용을 대폭 낮추어 승객 수송의 주축이 될 것으로 예측하고 있다.
자율주행기술의 발전으로 교통사고는 줄어들 것으로 예상되지만, 교통사고의 원인은 더 복잡해질 것으로 예상된다. 일반 자동차에 의한 교통사고 원인 중 대부분은 운행자의 운전부주의 등에 의해 발생한다. 반면 자율주행 자동차는 정보통신기술 및 컴퓨터 시스템에 기반하기 때문에 시스템의 결함으로 인한 사고가 더 높은 비중을 차지할 것으로 예상된다. 자율주행자동차는 제조사의 자율주행시스템에 의해 운행되지만, 로보택시는 운송사업자가 원격으로 운행을 통제할 수도 있어 문제가 더욱 복잡하다. 따라서 로보택시의 사고는 통제시스템 관리자의 책임과 자율주행자동차 제조자의 책임을 구분하기 위해 사고원인에 대한 면밀한 검토가 필요하다. 운송사업자와 자율주행자동차 제조사간에 책임소재에 대한 분쟁을 방지하기 위해서는 배상책임주체와 다양한 사고원인도 함께 살펴볼 필요가 있다.
로보택시는 우리에게 많은 생활의 편의와 비용절감을 가져다 줄 것으로 예상된다. 그러나 로보택시로 인한 교통사고로 발생할 수 있는 법적책임과 보험적용에 관한 논란을 방지하고 신속한 피해자의 구제를 위하여 책임법제와 보험제도의 활용방안에 대해 고민하는 것은 반드시 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,자율주행기술을 지원하는 일본의 최근 입법동향과 시사점 = Recent legislative developments and suggestions in Japan that support automatic driving technology,"자율주행자동차,자율주행시스템,운전자,일본 도로운송차량법,일본 도로교통법,Automated motor vehicle,Automated Driving System(ADS),Driver,Road Transport Vehicle Law of JAPAN,Road Traffic Act of JAPAN","획기적인 기술발전도 기술의 완성과 함께 해당 기술을 사용할 수 있는 제도적 기반이 마련되어야 실질적으로 우리가 기술의 발전을 누릴 수 있게 되는 것이다.
현재로서는 우리나라에서 스스로 조향장치나 가·감속장치를 조작하여 목적지까지 이동할 수 있는 자율주행자동차가 개발된다고 해도 해당 차량이 실제 도로에서 주행을 할 수는 없는 상황이다.
이는 관련 법령의 제한에 의한 것으로 우리 도로교통법상 자동차를 운전하는 운전자는 사람만을 전제로 규정하고 있기 때문이다. 물론 지금 현재 시점에서 완벽하게 스스로 운행하는 자율주행자동차가 개발된 것은 아니지만, 자율주행기술이 발전하는 속도에 비해 그에 대비한 법제도적인 대응은 낮은 단계로 보인다.
기술을 발전시키기 위한 지원은 다양한 측면에서 이루어질 수 있으며, 그 중 한 가지는 법제도적 측면의 지원이다. 현재의 자율주행기술은 level 4 혹은 5의 상용화라는 수준에 이르지는 못하고 있으나 level 3의 기술은 상용화 단계에 이르고 있다. 그러나 현재 우리나라의 관련 법령은 level 3의 자율주행자동차도 도로를 운행할 수 없는 단계에 머물러 있다.
자율주행자동차가 공도를 주행할 수 있는 수준의 법제도를 갖추는 것은 미국, 일본, 독일, 영국 등 많은 국가에서 일어나고 있는 공통적인 움직임이다.
구체적인 내용이라는 측면에서는 위에서 살펴본 일본이나 미시건주와 같이 자율주행시스템을 운전자로 규정하고 그에 따른 제도를 정비하는 형태가 될 수도 있을 것이며 또는 독일의 경우와 같이 인간운전자의 개념을 유지하면서 level 3의 자율주행자동차가 공도에서 주행할 수 있도록 하는 형태가 될 수도 있을 것이다.
중요한 것은 level 3의 자율주행자동차도 도로를 운행할 수 없는 단계를 넘어서도록 해당 규정을 정비하는 것이다. 그런 의미에서 2019년 일본의 자율주행차 관련 입법 동향을 살펴봄으로써 우리나라 입법에 시사점을 주고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

책임법제를 설계하는 구체적인 방식으로는 영미의 ADSE 방식이나 ADP 방식과 독일의 의제적 방식을 생각해 볼 수 있는데, 우리 자동차손해배상 보장법은 영미와 달리 준(準)무과실책임주의에 입각하고 있기 때문에 반드시 영미식의 방식을 채택해야 할 필요는 없고, 독일식도 가능하다. 그러나 자율주행시스템이 고도화될수록 독일의 의제적 방식은 설득력을 얻기 어렵다. 구체적으로 어떠한 방식을 취할지에 대해서는 레벨 4 기술개발과 운행방식에 관한 추이와 세계적인 입법 추이를 좀 더 지켜보고 결정해도 늦지 않다고 본다.
그보다는 레벨 4 자율주행차 사고에 대한 제조물 책임과 제조물 책임법제를 명확히 하는 것이 더 시급하다. 현행 제조물 책임법의 해석론에 의해서도 제조사에게 책임을 지우는 것이 불가능하지는 않지만, 법적 불확실성을 제거하기 위해서 제조물 책임법을 개정하거나 특별법을 제정하여 레벨 4 자율주행차 사고에 대한 차량제조사의 책임을 명확하고 구체적으로 정하는 것이 타당하다고 생각한다. 자율주행시스템을 제조사가 주도적으로 개발했는지 여부, 차체부품과 자율주행시스템을 조달받은 경우 당해 회사 간의 계약의 내용이 어떻게 구성되어 있는지, 사고유형별 네트워크 관리자와 도로관리자의 책임 등 구체적인 사안별로 책임의 주체와 범위를 명확히 하는 입법이 필요하고, 그 책임을 보험을 통해서 처리할 수 있도록 적합한 보험의 개발이 요구된다고 본다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

현대자동차는 2020년 1월 7일 개최된 ‘국제전자제품박람회2020(CES 2020: Consumer Electronics Show 2020)’에서 ‘개인용 비행체(PAV)’의 컨셉트 모델 ‘S-A1’을 공개하면서, 이와 함께 현대자동차가 구상하는 ‘도심항공모빌리티(UAM: Urban Air Mobility)’ 체계를 함께 공개한 바 있다. ‘도심항공모빌리티(UAM)’은 ‘개인용 비행체(PAV)’를 이용하여 이용자들이 도심지 내에서 지상의 교통정체에서 자유롭게 이동할 수 있도록 하고, ‘모빌리티 환승거점(HUB)’를 기반으로 착륙 이후에는 도심지내 주요 시설로 바로 이동할 수 있는 미래 모빌리티 생태계를 구축하고 2028년 그 상용화를 목표로 하고 있다. 이와 같이 정부(국토교통부, 산업통상자원부)나 기업(현대자동차 등)에서 발표한 전략을 살펴보면 미래의 도심지내 교통수단은 지상에는 ‘자율주행자동차’가 달리고, 공중에는 ‘개인용 비행체(PAV)’가 날아다니는 모습을 향후 10년 이내에 현실화될 것이 기대된다 할 것이다.
다만, ‘도심항공모빌리티(UAM)’ 체계가 ‘개인용 비행체(PAV)’를 기반으로 한다는 점에서 항공, 전자, 전기, 통신, 정비 등 관련 기술이나 환승거점(HUB) 등과 같은 시설의 구축이 매우 중요하다 할 것이지만, 최우선시 되어야 하는 것은 이러한 ‘개인용 비행체(PAV)’가 자유롭게 이동할 수 있는 공간을 어떻게 확보할 것인지에 대한 검토라 할 것이다. ‘자율주행자동차’의 경우에는 기존 도로 위에서 이동하면 될 것이지만 ‘개인용 비행체(PAV)’는 지상이 아닌 공중을 비행한다는 점에서 기존 도로의 이용이 어렵기 때문이다. 만약 이에 대한 부분이 우선 해결되지 못한다면 향후 ‘도심항공모빌리티(UAM)’ 체계의 상용화는 어려울 것이다.
이에 본 논문은 ‘도심항공모빌리티(UAM)’ 체계의 구축 및 그 상용화를 위한 핵심장치인 ‘개인용 비행체(PAV)’의 상용화를 위해 구축되어야 할 시설 및 도심지내 그 이동 공간에 대한 검토를 통해 ‘개인용 비행체(PAV)’의 도심지내 운영에 관한 법적쟁점을 제시하고 그 개선방안에 관한 법적 검토를 수행하고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,자율주행차의 발전단계 따른 형사책임에 관한 연구 = A Study on the Criminal Responsibility in the Development Stage of Self-driving car,"Autonomous Vehicles,product liability,car operator,corporate criminal responsibility,fault responsibility,자율주행차,제조물책임법,운행자,기업의 형사책임,과실책임","자율주행차의 경우 주지하는 바와 같이 운전을 시작하고 목적지를 입력하는 것 외에는 사람이 구체적인 운전 행위에 개입을 하지 않는 구조로 되어 있다. 그리하여 관련 법령인 도로교통법이나 교통사고처리특례법 상의 ‘운전자’에 해당하지 않게 되어, 자율주행차 운행 중 사고가 발생하였을 때, 그 사고에 대한 책임 소재의 불명확성으로 인해 누가 형사책임을 부담해야 할 것인가라는 문제에 직면하게 된다. 즉, 이러한 문제는, 종래의 운전자의 역할이 자율주행차 또는 자율주행시스템으로 운행의 주체가 전환되기 때문에, 사고발생시 그 책임의 주체를 현행 법제도하에서 누가 부담해야 하는 지를 확정하기가 어렵기 때문이다. 따라서 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 우선, 자율주행차의 운행·운전에 대한 행위자를 특정하고자 한다. 한편 자율주행차 또한 도로를 이용하는 자동차로서의 성격을 가지고 있다. 따라서 현행 자동차와 관련된 법규정을 통해 자율주행차의 운행·운전에 대한 행위자 특정이 가능하다고 생각된다. 자동차와 관련된 법규정으로는 자동차손해보장법, 자동차관리법, 도로교통법, 자동차손해보장법 등이 있다. 각 법률들은 공통적으로 ‘자동차를 용법에 따라 사용’ 또는 ‘관리’하는 것을 ‘운행’ 또는 ‘운전’으로 규정하고 있고, 이러한 운행이나 운전을 하는 자를 ‘운전자’로 정의하고 있다. 이와 같은 현행 법규정을 레벨2단계와 레벨3단계 부분적 자율주행차의 운행 중 발생한 사고에 적용하여 보면, 부분적 자율주행차를 ‘사용’ 또는 ‘관리’하는 자가 운행 중 발생한 사고에 대한 책임의 주체인 ‘행위자’ 된다. 한편 위와 같은 현행 법규정을 레벨4단계 완전자율주행차의 운행 중 사고에 적용하는 경우에도, 완전자율주행차의 ‘보유자’나 ‘운전자’가 그 ‘용법’에 따라 자율주행차를 ‘사용’ 또는 ‘관리’하는 경우에 책임의 주체인 ‘행위자’가 된다고 생각한다. 왜냐하면 완전자율주행차의 경우 자율주행차를 ‘사용’ 또는 ‘관리’하는 자가 ‘탑승자’가 될 것이고, 그가 완전자율주행차의 ‘용법’에 따라 목적지를 입력하고 운행 중 또는 운행으로 인한 사고가 발생하였다면, 탑승자가 그 사고 책임의 주체인 행위자 될 것이기 때문이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

근대도시의 형태와 자동차 중심 문화의 부작용으로 보행권을 주장해 온 지, 유럽 사회는 반세기, 우리나라는 유럽의 반이 흘렀다. 보행문화 확산은 성공하였지만, 교통수단으로서 보행은 공감을 얻지 못하고 있다. 하지만 도시의 교통문제, 환경문제, 사람의 안전문제를 안고 있는 이 시대는 보행정책의 지속적 확대를 요구하고 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   ○ 2008년 세계경제위기를 겪은 경남은 2010년 이후 조선해양플랜트산업의 하락에서 비롯된 지역경제의 추락이 극에 달하고 있음
    - 중형조선소인 21세기 조선, spp, 신아조선 등의 도산에서 이제는 성동조선과 stx조선까지 위험에 봉착함
   ○ 여기에 한국GM 위기처럼 경남도내 한국GM창원공장의 위기가 동시에 다가오고 있는 등 지역경제의 골이 깊어지고 있음
   ○ 다양한 대책 가운데 정부의 ‘산업위기대응특별지역 지정’을 통해 지역경제를 회생해 보고자 함(조선업, 자동차산업)
    - 산업위기대응특별지역 지정기준에 따라 거제, 통영, 고성, 창원 등 도내 주요지역에 대해 정부가 정한 산업위기대응특별지역 지정기준과 요건을 충족하는가에 대한 분석하여 제시함
  □ 분석결과
   ○ 지정대상 행정구역 범위는 「지방자치법」제2조제1항 제2호에 따른 시 · 군 · 구를 기준으로 하고, 지역의 산업구조 등 경제권역에 따라 여러 시 · 구를 묶어서 신청할 수가 있음
    - 지정요건으로, 해당 지역이나 몇 개의 지역을 묶은 지역을 대상으로 산업특화도, 지역내 비중, 지역산업구조 다양성, 기업경기실사지수, 광제조업 생산지수, 아파트매매가격지수 등을 기준으로 분석함
   ○ 한국산업분류표(KSICs)에 따른 전체 산업을 대상으로 분석한 결과, 거제시와 통영시 및 통영시와 고성군을 묶을 경우에도 산업위기대응특별지역 지정요건을 충족함
   ○ 창원시 전체를 대상으로 분석한 경우, 이들 일부 지정요건을 약간씩 충족하지 못하지만, 본문의 (표2)와 (표3)에서 보는 것처럼 종사자 수나 생산액의 최근 하락폭이 최근 들어 엄청나게 큼. 특히 현재 창원시는 조선선박, 자동차, 엔진, 철강, 전자 등 모든 업종에서 위기를 겪고 있음. 따라서 산업위기대응특별지역 지정기준④의 “주된 산업 중 2개 이상”, 즉 창원시의 선박, 자동차, 선박엔진 등의 위기가 가중되므로 신청이 가능하고 또한 지정할 요건을 충분히 갖추고 있다고 사료됨

2018,설 체감심리의 7가지 괴리,,"■개 요
설 체감심리를 살펴보는 것은 과거 명절 분위기와 현재를 비교하고 경기 수준에 대한 이해, 설 이후 경기 방향성 예측을 위해 중요하다. 올해 설 체감심리의 경우 분야별 회복 속도의 차이로 과거보다 체감심리 양극화가 심화되었다는 점이 특징이다. 본 연구에서는 올해 설 체감심리의 괴리 현상이 나타나고 있는 7개 부문의 특징을 살펴보고 시사점을 도출하였다.
■설 체감심리의 7가지 괴리
최근 나타나고 있는 체감심리의 특징으로는 첫째, (가계와 기업 간 괴리) 가계와 비교하여 기업의 심리 회복이 미흡하다. 2017년 초까지 나아지는 모습을 보이던 경제심리지수가 최근 횡보하고 있다. 경제심리지수는 가계와 기업의 심리로 구성되어 있다. 경제심리지수 구성항목 중 가계 관련 심리지표는 다소 나아진 모습이다. 반면 기업들의 심리 지표는 전반적으로 둔화하는 모습을 보이며 가계와 경기를 보는 시각이 상당한 차이를 보여주고 있다.
둘째, (소득계층 간 괴리) 고소득층과 비교하여 저소득층의 체감심리 회복이 미진하다. 월 소득이 400만원대인 가계의 소비지출전망은 2018년 1월 기준 115p, 500만원 이상 가계는 112p로 여타 소득 계층을 웃돈다. 반면 월 소득 100만원 미만 가계의 소비지출전망은 95p, 월 소득 100만원대 가계의 소비지출전망은 100p로 낮았다. 2013년 이후부터 타 계층과 괴리되며 낮아지기 시작한 저소득층 소비심리는 아직 회복하지 못하는 모습이다. 저소득층의 체감심리가 낮은 이유는 더딘 근로소득 향상, 취약한 고용환경 등이다. 최근 저소득층은 임금상승에 대한 기대는 높아지고 있지만 취업에 대한 기대는 오히려 낮아지고 있다.
셋째, (연령별 괴리) 청장년층 체감심리는 양호하지만 고령층 체감심리는 부진하다. 소비지출전망은 2018년 1월 기준 30대 이하 116p, 40대 가구 114p, 50대 가구는 106p를 기록하였다. 반면 60대 가구의 소비지출전망은 99p, 70세 이상 가구의 경우 98p로 다른 연령층 보다 크게 낮았다. 고령층 가구의 소비지출 전망은 2013년 하반기부터 2017년 초까지 부진한 모습을 보이다 반등하였으나 최근 다시 악화하였다. 고령층은 노후에 대한 부담감이 여전히 크다. 최근에는 고령층의 경기에 대한 부정적 시각이 늘었으며 취업기회에 대한 전망 역시 2018년 1월에 크게 낮아졌다.
넷째, (지역 간 괴리) 대구·경북, 경남, 울산, 부산 등 영남 지역의 체감심리 회복이 지연되고 있다. 2018년 1월 기준 부산의 소비자심리지수는 104.3p 대구·경북은 103.9p, 경남 103.5p울산 103.5p로 전국 평균인 109.9p를 크게 밑돌았다. 영남 지역의 소비자심리지수는 2016년 이후부터 다른 지역의 소비자심리지수와 괴리되기 시작하였다. 영남 지역에 소재한 기업들이 업황 부진, 구조조정 등으로 어려움을 겪으며 지역 고용시장과 부동산 시장 등이 위축된 것이 체감심리 회복 지연의 주된 원인이다.
다섯째, (수출기업, 내수기업 괴리) 수출기업 체감심리는 양호한 반면 내수기업 심리는 부진하다. 수출기업의 업황BSI가 2018년 1월 기준 86p인 반면 내수기업은 업황BSI가 71p로 상대적으로 낮았다. 수출기업과 내수기업의 업황BSI 격차는 2018년 1월 기준 15p로 2007년 11월 19p 이후 가장 크다. 2017년 초부터 수출기업의 체감심리는 빠르게 호전되었다. 내수기업의 경우 2012년 이후부터 현재까지 체감 심리 회복이 이루어지지 못하고 있다. 글로벌수요 확대로 수출 증가율은 높지만 아직 내수산업 확대로 이어지지 못하며 내수기업 심리가 부진한 것으로 판단된다.
여섯째, (대기업, 중소기업 괴리) 대기업 체감심리는 양호하지만 중소기업 심리는 크게 악화되었다. 대기업의 경우 업황BSI가 2018년 1월 기준 85p였던 반면 중소기업은 업황BSI가 63p로 매우 부진하다. 대기업과 중소기업의 업황BSI 격차는 2018년 1월 기준 22p로 금융위기 직전인 2008년 5월 23p 이후 가장 크다. 대기업의 체감심리는 2016년 초반을 저점으로 지속해서 높아지는 모습이다. 반면 중소기업의 체감심리는 2017년 9월까지 다소 회복되는 모습을 보이다 최근 다시 급락하였다. 중소기업들은 내수판매가 부진한 가운데 자금사정 역시 크게 악화한 것이 체감심리 위축의 배경으로 꼽힌다.
일곱째, (산업 간 괴리) 주력산업 중 전자, 화학, 철강 산업의 체감심리는 양호하지만 자동차, 조선, 석유·정제 산업의 심리는 매우 부진하였다. 자동차 산업의 업황 BSI는 59p, 석유·정제 55p, 조선 49p를 기록하며 다른 주력산업들보다 체감심리가 매우 낮았다. 자동차 산업의 경우 2010년부터 체감심리가 서서히 낮아지기 시작하였으며 특히 최근에 급락하였다. 조선업의 경우 2016년 체감심리가 급락한 이후 아직 회복하지 못하는 모습이다. 석유·정제 산업은 2016년 10월 저점을 기록한 이후 다소 회복하였으나 최근 다시 급락하였다.
■시사점
올해 설을 앞두고 경제주체들의 체감심리가 부문별로 크게 괴리되는 모습이다. 양극화되고 있는 부문 간 체감심리를 완화하기 위해서는 첫째, 가계 대비 미진한 기업심리 회복을 위해 노력해야 한다. 둘째, 저소득층의 소비심리가 회복할 수 있도록 양질의 일자리 마련, 기초생활보장제도 강화 등이 필요하다. 셋째, 고령층의 소비심리가 악화하지 않도록 사적연금 활성화, 가교일자리 마련 등의 정책도 보완되어야 한다. 넷째, 수출과 내수산업이 균형 있게 성장할 수 있는 토양을 조성하는 데 주력해야 한다. 다섯째, 내수회복 지연, 금리인상 등으로 영향을 받을 수 있는 중소기업의 경영환경 악화에 대비해야 한다. 여섯째, 개별 산업의 경기국면 판단과 향후 경기 방향성을 예측하여 산업별 맞춤형 대책을 수립해 나가야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2017 7월 인텔은 자동주행자동차가 새로운 시대를 이끌 것이며 그 시장가치가 7조 달러에 이를 것으로 추산했다. 아직 자율주행차량이 일반 도로에서 보이진 않지만, 자율주행차량의 시험운전이 차근차근 진행되어 가고 있으며, 많은 국가들은 이런 변화를 따라잡기 위해 많은 노력을 기울이고 있다.
이런 급변하는 상황 속에서, 2017 10월에 AEV 법안이 영국 의회에 발의되었다. AEV 법안은 다가오는 자율주행 시대에 선도적 위치를 선점하기 위한 영국의 장기적인 포석으로 볼 수 있으며, 주로 자율주행자동차와 관련된 사고를 처리하기 위한 보험문제를 다루고 있다. AEV 법안은 보험에 가입된 자율주행차량에 의한 손해에 보험회사가 책임을 지는 단일 보험자 방식을 채택하고 있다. 보험에 가입되어 있지 않은 경우라면 차량의 소유주가 법적 책임이 있으며, 보험회사는 보험가입자의 잘못이 있는경우에 법적책임을 배제하거나 제한할 수 있는 권리가 있다.
자율주행자동차의 출현은 전통적인 법적 책임의 분야를 모호하게 만들고 있다. 이러한 법적 불확실성은 자율주행차량이 자리 잡는데 가장 큰 장애물이라고 할 수 있다. 이러한 시기에 영국에서 제안된AEV Bill는 자율주행시대로 진입하기 위해 여전히 해결해야 하는 일이 많은 우리에게 좋은 사례가될 것으로 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,자율주행 차량 내 콘텐츠 이용 방식과 상황의 위급성에 따른 정보 제공 방식 제안,"자율주행 자동차,위급성,다중감각,정보 제공방식,클러스터링","자율주행 자동차 시대에는 더 이상 탑승자가 주행 중 앞을 볼 필요가 없어서 차 내에서 독서를 하거나, 업무를 처리하거나, 영화나 게임 같은 엔터테인먼트를 즐기는 등의 다양한 콘텐츠 소비가 일어날 것이다. 이런 상황에서 기존의 시각정보 위주로 구성되어 있는 정보제공방식은 다양한 감각을 사용하며 콘텐츠를 이용하고 있는 탑승자의 주의를 환기하기에 충분하지 않을 것이다. 하지만 그렇다고 한꺼번에 시각, 청각, 촉각 정보를 모두 사용하는 것은 사용자의 짜증을 유발할 수도 있으며, 모든 위험도에서 같은 수준으로 정보를 제공하는 것은 불필요 할 수도 있다. 이에 본 연구에서는 자율주행 자동차 시대의 콘텐츠 소비방식이 시각, 청각, 촉각 사용 수준과 주변 상황 인지능력, 몰입도, 기분 측면에서 어떻게 다를 지를 설문조사와 클러스터링을 통해 알아보았다. 그 결과 총 7 개의 서로 다른 유형을 도출해 냈으며, 각 유형과 위험도 수준에 따라 어떤 감각채널을 사용해서 어떤 방식으로 정보를 제공하는 게 좋을 지에 대해서 제안하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Light-duty 차량의 대기오염 물질 배출량은 거리 당 무게로 규제되어 있어 주행주기가 결과에 영향을 미칠 수 있다. 차량의 배출가스는 주행및 환경조건, 주행습관 등에 따라 크게 달라진다. 극단적인 외기온도는 배출가스를 증가시키는데, 이것은더 많은 연료가 실내를 가열하거나 냉각해야하기 때문이다. 또한 높은 주행속도는 증가된 항력을 극복하기 위해 필요한 에너지로 인해 배출가스 량을 증가시킨다. 일반적으로 상승하는 차량속도와 비교할 때, 급격한 차량가속도도 배출가스를 증가시킨다. 부가적인 장치 (에어컨 또는 히터)와 도로경사 또한 배출가스를 증가시킨다. 본 연구에서는 3대의 light-duty 차량을 가지고 light-duty 차량의 배출가스 규제에 사용되는 WLTP, NEDC 및 FTP-75로 시험을 하였으며, 배출가스가 다른 주행 사이클에 의해 얼마나 많은 영향을 받을 수있는지를 측정하였다. 배출 가스는 통계적으로 의미있는 차이를 보이지 않았다. 최대 배출 가스는 주로 냉각 된 엔진 조건에 의해 야기되는 WLTP의 저속 단계에서 발견된다. 냉각 된 엔진 상태에서 배출가스의 양은 시험 차량과 크게 다르다. 이는 WLTP 구동 사이클에 대처하기 위해, 이 측면에서 다른 기술적 솔루 션이 필요하다는 것을 의미한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이러한 운행자책임의 주체인 “운행자”로는 자동차의 소유자와 같은 보유자가 대표적인경우이지만, 자율주행차에서는 새로운 운행자가 등장하고 있다. 바로 자율주행시스템 ADS(Automated Driving System)의 운전을 지배하는 ADS Entiy 개념이다. 자율주행차에서는운전자 뿐만 아니라 ADS가 운전작업을 담당하게 되는데, ADS 의 운전지배는 ADS를 자기인증하고 ADS 운전에 대해 대신 책임을 지는 ADS Entiy에 의해 행해지므로, ADSE가ADS를 간접지배한다고 볼 수 있다. 따라서 ADSE는 자율주행차에 있어 새로운 운행자책임의 주체가 될 수 있다.

2018,한국형 레몬법과 다른 나라와의 비교,,"우리나라에서 자동차는 재산 목록에 들어갈 정도로 고가의 돈을 지급해야만 구매할 수 있다. 구매 직 후 차량을 인도한다는 ‘인도증’에 서명을 한 직후에는 자동차에 큰 결함이 발견되어도 A/S를 통한 수리는 일정기간 동안 무상으로 가능하나, 교환이나 환불을 해 주는 경우는 거의 없다. 우리는 새 차에 대한 교환이나 환불을 위해 제조사를 상대로 싸우지만 대부분 포기하고 만다.
  이렇게 신차를 구입한 후에 차량의 결함이 생겨도 국내에서는 환불이나 보상을 받지 못g던 것이 지금까지의 현실이었으며 자동차 관련 규정은 소비자 보호법 가운에 가장 낙후된 법이어서 2019.1월부터 시행이 되는 한국형 레몬법에 많은 관심이 쏠리고 있다.
  미국에서는 소비자를 보호한다는 취지하에 1975년 제럴드 포드 미국 대통령이 공포한 ‘레몬법’이 대표적이다. “오렌지인 줄 알고 샀는데 나중에 보니 오렌지를 닮은 신 레몬(불량품)이었다”는 말에서 유래한 법이다. 레몬법의 정식 명칭은 법안을 발의한 의원들의 이름을 딴 ‘맥너슨-모스법’이다.
  한국판 레몬법은 2019년 1월부터 시행이 되는데 새 자동차를 구입하는 소비자에게는 지대한 관심거리이다. 실제 적용을 할 때 한국형 레몬법은 미국보다는 상당히 까다로운 조건이어서 상대적으로 소비자가 적용 받기가 쉬울지 의문이다.
  본 연구에서는 2절에서 한국형 레몬법의 주요내용을 살펴보고, 3절에서는 미국의 레몬법을 살펴보고 한국형 레몬법과의 차이점을 비교하고자 한다. 마지막으로 결론에서는 문제점들을 살펴보고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  분석 결과, 경쟁의 원인에 있어서는 공정거래위원회와 국토교통부가 자동차소비자정책에서의 주도권을 유지/확보하기 위한 관할권 경쟁을 벌이면서, 조직 심리적 요인, 제도적 요인, 환경적 요인 등이 경쟁에 영향을 미친 것으로 분석되었다. 또, 경쟁의 양상에 있어서는 자동차 교환?환불 정책에서 자신들의 정책역량을 강화하기 위한 근거법률의 확보, 신차 교환?환불 요건 규정 수단, 기구 신설 및 반대, 분쟁해결 도구에 관한 경쟁을 벌인 것으로 분석되었다. 그리고 두 부처는 이러한 정책역량 강화 경쟁을 벌이는 과정에서 자신의 강점 부각 및 상대의 약점 공략, 소비자권익이라는 공익적 가치의 논리 접근, 개별적 정책 추진, 실질적 소통 노력 미흡 등의 경쟁 행태를 표출한 것으로 분석되었다.
  이러한 결과를 토대로, 이 연구는 소비자정책에서의 경쟁을 어디까지 인정할 것인지나 어떤 분야에 대해 가외성을 인정할 것인지에 대한 정책적 판단이 필요하며, 불필요한 경쟁 및 경쟁에 따른 부작용을 해소하기 위해 제3자의 조정기제를 적극 활용할 필요가 있음을 제언하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  이 글이 제기하는 질문은 세 가지이다. 첫째, 1990년대 서울 공간 변화의 특징이 무엇인가? 둘째, 1990년대 강우석의 영화들은 서울의 주거공간과 도시공간을 어떻게 재현하고 있는가? 셋째, 그러한 주거공간과 도시공간의 영화적 재현을 통해 우리가 독해할 수 있는 당대의 가치체계나 욕망, 불안 등은 어떠한 것인가?
  1990년대는 경제적 호황과 더불어 중산층이 급부상한 시기였다. 이 시기에 서울은 아파트 단지가 대규모로 개발되었고 교통망이 크게 확충되었다. 이에 따라 도시 분산화가 이루어졌고, 아파트는 서울 중산층의 대표적 주거공간이 되었다.
  강우석의 영화는 1991년까지 주로 현실 비판의 영화였으며, 아파트를 부정적 이미지로 재현하였다. 그러나 1992년 이후 아파트는 중산층 인물의 평범하고도 일상적인 주거공간으로 제시되었다. 이는 당시 아파트가 중산층이 소유하기를 원하는 욕망의 대상이 된 현실을 반영한 것이며, 강우석의 영화는 현실과 동경의 어색한 부정교합 형태로 중산층의 욕망을 소비하게 만들었다.
  또한, 당시 한국영화가 도시의 화려함에 주목한 반면, 강우석의 영화는 개발이 되지 않았거나 이미 버려진 도시의 주변공간을 주목하는 경향이 있었다. 이것은 발전의 미완을 상기시켜 주었다. 한편, 강우석의 영화는 새로운 도시공간으로서 자동차 실내공간을 제시하였다. 당시 중산층의 사적 욕망과 소비 대상이었던 자동차의 실내공간은 이제 개인의 자유와 프라이버시가 보장된 은밀한 사적 공간으로 재현되었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,"음주운전에 의한 복수 운전면허취소처분 판례의 문제점과 관련법제의 개선방안 - 대법원 2018.2.28.선고 2017두67476 판결을 중심으로 - = A Problem about a Precedent of the Multiple Driver's License Cancellation Caused by Drunk Driving, and an Improvement of Related Legislation","음주운전, 운전면허 행정처분, 재량준칙, 복수 운전면허취소, 도로교통법, Drunk driving, Administrative Penalties of Driver's license, Discretionary criterion, Multiple driver's license revocation, Road Traffic Act","현행 도로교통법 및 제반 관련 법규에서는 일정 자격을 취득한 해당 운전자에 한하여 운전면허 자격을 부여하고, 각 개별적 요건을 갖춘 경우에 복수의 운전면허를 발급함으로써 운전자의 운전면허를 통합관리하고 있다. 또한 음주운전 등 운전자가 준수해야 할 안전주의의무를 위반한 경우에는 운전자격을 박탈하는 등의 행정제재를 규정하고 있다.
오늘날 자동차 운전은 생활의 편리함을 추구하는 도구를 넘어 생계수단과 밀접한 관련이 있지만, 이러한 자동차 이용의 증가와는 달리 국민들의 자동차 운전에 대한 안전주의의무의 인식은 상대적으로 부족하다. 특히, 음주운전과 관련해서는, 한 번쯤 누구나 행할 수 있는 실수 정도로 취급하며 관용을 미덕으로 생각하는 것이 사회적 분위기였다. 그러나 지속적으로 증가하는 음주운전에 따른 사회 문제와 사회전체가 부담해야 하는 경제적 손실비용의 증가로 인해 음주운전은 더 이상 용인되어야 할 개인의 문제가 아니라 함께 공동대응해야 할 사회문제가 되었다.
이런 사회분위기를 반영하듯, 최근 대법원은 2018. 2. 28. 선고 2017두67476 판결을 통해 음주운전에 대한 일반 예방적 측면을 적극 반영하여 복수의 운전면허 취소가 위법·부당하지 않다는 내용을 판시하였다. 이 판결은 음주운전에 대해 현재 우리나라는 외국에 비해 제재가 약하기 때문에 음주운전 근절을 위해 제재를 강화하는 등의 예방적 대책이 필요하다는 측면에서 볼 때, 환영할 만한 판결이다. 반면, 과거의 유사한 사례와 음주운전에 의한 복수 운전면허의 취소범위가 상이한 결과를 가져왔다는 점에서는 그 타당성이 검토되어야 할 판례이다.
따라서 본 논문에서는 음주운전에 의한 복수 운전면허 취소와 관련한 기존 판례의 입장과 최근 대법원 판결을 비교 고찰하는 방법을 통해서 그 차이점과 문제점을 분석하고, 이를 기초로 일선 행정처분을 행하는 공무원들이 업무를 수행함에 있어 불필요한 혼란을 예방하고 행정행위의 실효성을 확보하기 위해 관련법제인 도로교통법 및 동법 시행규칙 등의 제반규정에 대한 개선방안을 모색함으로써 통일성 있는 행정제재와 행정기관의 재량권 행사의 기준을 마련하고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

먼저 상법총칙, 상행위법 분야에서는 다음과 같이 3개의 대법원 판례를 살펴보았다.
1) 유질계약이 상법 제59조에 따라 유효하기 위하여 질권설정자가 상인이어야 하는지 여부에 관하여 질권설정계약의 피담보채권이 상행위로 인하여 생긴 채권이면 충분하고 질권설정자가 상인이어야 하는 것은 아니라고 한 판결(2017다207499), 2) 상호 속용 양수인의 책임을 규정한 상법 제42조 제1항이 영업임대차에 유추 적용될 수 있는지 여부에 관하여 그 유추적용을 부정한 판결(2016다47737), 3) 상법 제64조 상사시효의 적용에 관하여 당사자가 민법에 따른 소멸시효기간을 주장한 경우에도 법원은 직권으로 상법에 따른 소멸시효기간을 적용할 수 있다고 한 판결(2016다258124) 등이다. 이들 세 개의 판례는 사실관계는 다르지만 법리적으로 보면 종래의 대법원 판결의 태도를 거의 유지하고 있다는 점을 알 수 있다.
판결 1)의 경우 채무자가 비상인인 경우에도 상법 제59조가 적용되는 가의 문제에 관하여 대법원은 질권설정자가 비상인이어도 상법 제59조가 적용된다고 밝히고 있으나, 사안은 채권자와 채무자 모두 상인이고 질권설정자가 비상인인 경우에 해당하므로 이 문제에 관한 대법원 판례의 명확한 태도가 나타나 있지 않다는 점이다. 다만 판례의 태도를 전체적으로 보면 이를 긍정하고 있는 취지로 해석될 여지가 있다. 판결 2)의 경우 영업임대차에 상법 제42조 제1항이 유추 적용되지 않는다는 대법원 판례의 종래 견해가 유지되고 있는데, 사안의 경우 특징적인 것은 영업임대차가 해지된 경우에도 마찬가지로 상법 제42조 제1항이 유추 적용되지 않는다고 판시한 점이다. 판례 3)은 시효주장은 변론주의의 적용대상이 아니어서 법원이 직권으로 적용할 시효규정을 판단할 수 있다는 취지이며 상사시효에서 단기시효를 적용한 사례이다.
다음으로 보험법 분야에서 다음과 같이 9개의 대법원 판례를 살펴보았다.
1) 책임보험에서 피해자의 직접청구권에 관한 판례(2012다86895, 86901 전합), 2) 보험금 채권에 대한 압류 후 채무자에 의한 보험계약 해지와 압류의 실효여부에 관한 판례(2016다239840), 3) 책임보험에서 피해자의 직접청구권을 대위 행사하는 경우 구상권제한의 법리 주장 가부에 관하여 이를 부인한 판례(2016다271226), 4) 보험금부정취득목적, 고지의무 위반 및 사기로 인한 보험계약해지에 관하여 중복적용설을 취한 판례(2014다 234827), 5) 변호사 사무장의 등기비용 횡령과 보험자 면책사유인 피보험자의 ‘중대한 과실’여부에 관하여 중과실을 인정한 판례(2014다68891), 6) 변호사 사무장이 등기비용을 임의 소비한 사례에서 변호사배상책임보험에서의 보험사고 해당성을 부인한 판례( 2014다 20998), 7) 자동차 운행 중 동승자가 뛰어내려 사망한 사고가 ‘승객이 고의나 자살행위로 사망한 경우’에 해당하여 자동차손해배상보장법상 보험자가 면책되는지 여부에 관하여 운행자의 면책을 부정한 판례(2016다216954), 8) 외국적 요소가 있는 책임보험계약에서 제3자 직접청구권 행사에 관한 법률관계의 준거법에 관한 판례(2015다42599), 9) 손해보험계약에서의 보험회사의 담보책임의 범위에 관한 판례(2015다245145) 등이다. 보험법 분야의 판례는 인보험과 손해보험에 걸쳐서 다양한 판례가 나왔으며 특히 책임보험과 해상보험분야에서 문제되고 있는 상법 제724조의 피해자 직접청구권의 법리가 적용된 판례가 다수 등장하고 있다는 점이 특색이라고 할 수 있다. 2012다86895, 86901 전원합의체판결의 경우 임차 외 건물부분의 화재로 인한 임차인의 손해배상책임과 관련하여 종래의 판결을 변경하여 임대인에게 임차인의 계약위반에 대한 입증책임을 지움으로써 임차인보호를 도모하였다는 점에서 긍정적인 평가를 할 수 있을 것이다. 향후 다양한 보험판례를 통하여 보험법 법리의 균형있는 발전을 기대해 본다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,“업무용승용차 관련비용의 손금불산입 등 특례 제도”에 관한 소고(小考) = A critical review on “the special taxation about exclusion from deductible expenses of business purpose vehicles’ related costs”,"업무용승용차,Business purpose vehicles,사적 사용,Private use,사회적인 요구 및 정책,Public demand and policy,실질과세의 원칙,The principle of substantial taxation,조세평등주의,Tax equalitarianism","법인세법 제27조의2 및 소득세법 제33조의2로 2016. 1. 1.부터 시행되고 있는 업무용승용차 관련비용의 손금불산입 등 특례 제도는 법인과 개인사업자의 업무용승용차의 사적 사용을 제한하고 응능부담의 원칙을 실현하기 위해 일정 요건에 따라 관련비용의 인정 기준을 마련한 제도로서 사회적인 요구 및 정책을 반영한 특별한 제도라고 할 것이다.본 연구의 목적은 2018년 업무용승용차 관련비용의 손금불산입 등 특례 제도와 관련한 최신 개정세법 사항을 반영하여 위 제도를 분석하고, 지금까지 논의된 업무용승용차와 관련된 최신 이슈를 검토하는 것뿐만 아니라 위 제도의 실효성을 제고하기 위한 여러 가지 개선방안도 제시한 데에 있다. 그리고 본 연구에서 제시하는 개선방안은 다음과 같다.첫째, 납세자의 입장을 고려해 볼 때 감가상각방법에 선택권을 부여하고 감가상각비 한도액을 차등화하여 규정할 필요가 존재한다. 둘째, 부동산임대업을 주된 사업으로 하는 등의 법인에 대한 손금인정범위 제한 규정은 조세평등주의에 반하므로 타당하지 않다. 셋째, 법인이 업무전용자동차보험에 가입하지 않는 경우와 업무전용자동차보험에 가입하였더라도 국세청장이 기획재정부장관과 협의하여 고시하는 운행기록부를 작성하지 않은 경우 행정규제를 할 수 있음을 별론으로 하더라도 실질과세의 원칙에 반하지 않도록 업무사용비율만큼의 손금 인정을 받을 수 있는 제도가 마련되어야 하며, 개인사업자(업무전용자동차보험 가입 조건은 없음)가 위 운행기록부를 작성하지 않은 경우도 마찬가지이다. 넷째, 업무용승용차의 감가상각비를 초과하는 금액에 대하여 법인세법 시행령에 따른 기타 사외유출의 소득처분은 유보로 소득처분을 하도록 해야 하며, 업무용승용차의 처분손실 중 한도를 초과하는 금액에 대하여 법인세법 시행령에 따른 기타 사외유출의 소득처분은 경제적 실질에 맞는 소득처분을 할 수 있도록 법을 개정하는 것이 필요하다. 다섯째, 위 특례 제도의 실효성을 제고하기 위해 운행기록 등 기재사항을 구체화할 필요가 존재한다. 마지막으로 위 특례 제도가 도입됨에 따라 업무사용비율을 계산하는 법정 산식이 도입되었을 뿐만 아니라 대법원 판례 및 헌법재판소 결정에서 설시한 내용은 구시대적인 것이므로 부가가치세법 제39조 제1항 제5호의 규정을 개정할 필요성이 있다.위 특례 제도는 신설된 이후 2년이라는 시간이 지났으나 그 2년 동안 매해 조문이 조금씩 개정되거나 추가되고 있는 제도로서 여전히 자리를 잡아가고 있는 과정 중에 있다고 생각된다. 우리나라의 자동차 누적 등록대수가 늘어나고 있고 수입차의 비중이 점점 증가하고 있는 오늘날에 본 연구가 행정부에서 업무용승용차 관련 정책을 수립하고 입법부에서 업무용승용차와 관련된 입법을 하는 데에 있어 조금이나마 도움이 되기를 바란다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Audi 차량은 ‘컨트롤러의 선택과 집중’, BMW 차량은 ‘드라이빙 중심의 최적화’, Benz의 차량은 ‘단순화와 최소화’, Lexus의 차량은 ‘조작분산의 제거’, KIA의 차량은 ‘시각적 안정감’을 HMI의 특징적 키워드로 도출할 수 있었다. 이것은 각 제조사들이 운전자의 드라이빙 제어 영역에 대한 정의와 해석이 다름을 보여준다. 본 연구는 외관으로 드러나지 않는 차량별 HMI의 특성을실제 주행상황에서 파악해보았다는 점에서 기존의 연구와 차별적인 의미를 갖는다. 군집주행, 자율주행과 같은 주행환경의 변화와 HMI의 변화에서도 실제 주행을 통해 인터랙션의 차이를 확인해보는 본 연구의 접근이 유용하게 활용될 수 있기를 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그럼에도 불구하고 현행법상 개인형 이동수단은 ‘원동기장치자전거’로 분류되어 운전면허를 필요로 하며, 보도나 자전거도로가 아닌 차도로만 통행할 수 있다. 그러나 개인형 이동수단을 차도에서 운행할 경우 자동차?이륜자동차 등에 비해서는 상대적으로 느린 속도로 이동하기 때문에 교통흐름에 방해가 될 수 있으며, 더 나아가 개인형 이동수단 운전자의 생명?신체에 대한 중대한 위험이 존재한다. 이러한 이유에서인지 대부분의 개인형 이동수단 운전자들은 차도가 아닌 자전거도로나, 보도로 주행하고 있으며, 이로 인해 보행자 등 다른 교통참여자들의 안전에 대한 위험을 야기하고 있다.
개인형 이동수단과 관련하여 발생하는 법과 현실의 괴리 문제를 해결하기 위해서는 도로교통법의 본질에 대한 이해로부터 출발하여야 한다. 일반 국민뿐만 아니라 도로교통행정청인 경찰 또한 도로교통법을 교통법규 위반행위를 단속하고 처벌하는 법률로 이해하고 있다. 그러나 개인형 이동수단에 대한 도로교통법의 적용에 있어 도로교통법의 주된 성격이 위험방지법이라는 점을 염두에 두어야 한다. 새로운 교통수단에 대한 규제 또는 규율을 함에 있어 위험방지라는 도로교통법의 ‘주된 목적’에 부합하도록 법을 해석하고, 적용하고, 형성할 필요가 있는 것이다. 만약 개인형 이동수단이 자동차?이륜자동차?원동기장치자전거 등 전형적인 교통수단에 비해 낮은 정도의 교통상 위험을 야기한다면 그러한 위험방지를 위해 필요한 정도로만 규율할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1960-70년대 당시 미국의 주류 미술은 미니멀리즘이었고 이는 동부 뉴욕을 중심으로 전개되었다. 이에 따라 서부 로스앤젤레스 미술은 상대적으로 덜 주목받게 되어 비주류 미술로 간주되었다. 심지어 미국 주류 미술계의 평론가들은 당시 로스앤젤레스의 미술을 뉴욕의 미니멀리즘과 비교하여 폄하하기도 했다. 이런 관점은 ‘피니쉬 페티쉬’와 ‘빛과 공간 미술’을 단순히 미니멀리즘의 아류로치부하게 되는 오류를 낳을 수 있고, 이로 인해 ‘피니쉬 페티쉬’와 ‘빛과 공간미술’만의 독자적인 특성이 간과될 수 있다.
‘피니쉬 페티쉬’와 ‘빛과 공간 미술’의 발전은 자동차 산업의 발달과 그에 따른 자동차 개조 문화의 유행, 항공우주 산업의 발전과 플라스틱 산업의 보편화등 당시 로스앤젤레스 지역 특유의 문화, 산업의 발전과 연관되어 있다. 이는모더니스트 회화의 형식적인 측면을 극단으로 추구하면서 나타난 미니멀리즘과는 근본적으로 다른 것이었다. 이러한 배경에 기반하여 발전한 ‘피니쉬 페티쉬’ 와 ‘빛과 공간 미술’은 관람자의 지각 작용을 유발하는 특성을 갖기도 했는데, 최근의 연구들은 이 점을 부각시켜 ‘피니쉬 페티쉬’와 ‘빛과 공간 미술’이 동시대미술에 끼친 영향을 분석했다. 작품에서 관람자의 경험을 중요시하는 동시대미술의 근원을 ‘피니쉬 페티쉬’와 ‘빛과 공간 미술’로 본 것이다. 이처럼1960-70년대에 나타난 ‘피니쉬 페티쉬’와 ‘빛과 공간 미술’의 영향은 동시대미술까지 이어져, 보다 더 새롭고 다양한 방식으로 능동적인 관람자의 역할을 이끌어내고 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

첫째, 납세자의 입장을 고려해 볼 때 감가상각방법에 선택권을 부여하고 감가상각비 한도액을 차등화하여 규정할 필요가 존재한다. 둘째, 부동산임대업을 주된 사업으로 하는 등의 법인에 대한 손금인정범위 제한 규정은 조세평등주의에 반하므로 타당하지 않다. 셋째, 법인이 업무전용자동차보험에 가입하지 않는 경우와 업무전용자동차보험에 가입하였더라도 국세청장이 기획재정부장관과 협의하여 고시하는 운행기록부를 작성하지 않은 경우 행정규제를 할 수 있음을 별론으로 하더라도 실질과세의 원칙에 반하지 않도록 업무사용비율만큼의 손금 인정을 받을 수 있는 제도가 마련되어야 하며, 개인사업자(업무전용자동차보험 가입 조건은 없음)가 위 운행기록부를 작성하지 않은 경우도 마찬가지이다. 넷째, 업무용승용차의 감가상각비를 초과하는 금액에 대해 법인세법 시행령에 따른 기타 사외유출의 소득처분은 유보로 소득처분을 하도록 해야 하며, 업무용승용차의 처분손실 중 한도를 초과하는 금액에 대해 법인세법 시행령에 따른 기타 사외유출의 소득처분은 경제적 실질에 맞는 소득처분을 할 수 있도록 법을 개정하는 것이 필요하다. 다섯째, 위 특례 제도의 실효성을 제고하기 위해 운행기록 등 기재사항을 구체화할 필요가 존재한다. 마지막으로 위 특례 제도가 도입됨에 따라 업무사용비율을 계산하는 법정 산식이 도입되었을 뿐만 아니라 대법원 판례 및 헌법재판소 결정에서 설시한 내용은 구시대적인 것이므로 부가가치세법 제39조 제1항 제5호의 규정을 개정할 필요성이 있다.
위 특례 제도는 신설된 이후 2년이라는 시간이 지났으나 그 2년 동안 매해 조문이 조금씩 개정되거나 추가되고 있는 제도로서 여전히 자리를 잡아가고 있는 과정 중에 있다고 생각된다. 우리나라의 자동차 누적 등록대수가 늘어나고 있고 수입차의 비중이 점점 증가하고 있는 오늘날에 본 연구가 행정부에서 업무용승용차 관련 정책을 수립하고 입법부에서 업무용승용차와 관련된 입법을 하는 데에 있어 조금이나마 도움이 되기를 바란다. 사용, 사회적인 요구 및 정책, 실질과세의 원칙, 조세평등주의",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A사의 분쟁사례의 경우 일단 보험계약자가 실제 주소변경은 통지하지 않았다. 그리고 보험자로서는 실제 주소를 알려고 노력은 일부 기울였다. 가령 이 사건의 경우 보험계약자측에서 장기보험 보험금청구이력은 없었으며, 약관대출 이력 및 자동차 등록증 제출이력도 없었다. 또한 A사 자동차 보험 처리 이력을 확인하였으나 주소지 및 휴대폰 연락처 변경사항을 확인할 수 없었다. 다만 피보험자가 A사 콜센터에 전화를 하여 본인명의 보험계약이 해지되어 있어 보험계약을 살리려면 어떻게 하는지 질문하여 상담사는 보험료 납입내역 및 부활시 추가 부담해야하는 보험료를 설명하였으며, 구체적인 부활방법은 계약을 관리하는 설계사와 상담해야 하므로 본 건 보험계약을 이관 받은 설계사의 전화번호를 SMS 발송한 사실이 있었다. 이때 피보험자의 휴대폰 번호가 계약당시와 달리 변경된 사실을 확인하고 연락처를 변경하였다. 그 것을 설계사에게 전달하여 주어서 설계사가 조치를 취하였으면 하는 ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,가로공간의 보행환경 개선을 위한 통합디자인 방안에 관한 연구 = A Study on the Integrated Design Method for Improvement ofPedestrian Environment in Street Space,"Street,Space,Street space,Integrated design,Guideline,가로,공간,가로공간,통합디자인,가이드라인","(연구배경 및 목적)  경제 수준이 향상됨에 따라 사람들은 좀 더 쾌적한 환경 속에서 외부활동을 영위하고 싶은 욕구 또한 증가하고 있다. 도시 내 가로공간은 일상 속에서 가장 쉽게 접할 수 있는 외부 생활공간 중의 하나이다. 지금까지 우리나라의 가로공간은 대부분 보행자의 입장보다는 자동차의 원활한 통행을 목적으로 계획되어져 왔다. 교통을 우선으로 한 설계지침으로 인해 도시 내에서 접하게 되는 가로공간은 ‘사람’이 아닌 ‘자동차’를 위한 구조나 기능으로 조성되어 있는 경우를 많이 발견하게 된다.  최근에는 공공디자인 개념이 확산되며 과거 차량 중심으로 계획되어 발생하게 되었던 문제들을 해결하기 위한 노력이 활발히 진행되고 있다. 그러나 대부분의 가로 개선사업들은 벤치나 가로등, 볼라드 등과 같이 시설물의 양적 확충에 초점이 맞추어 진행되고 있다. 배치, 형태, 시설물간의 연계성 등 통합적 관점에서의 고려가 결여된 무분별한 공간 조성 및 시설물 설치는 상호간의 부조화, 중복설치 등 다양한 문제점을 발생시키고 있다. 본 연구의 목적은 자동차 중심으로 설계되어 있는 현재의 가로공간을 사람 중심의 공간으로 전환시킴으로써 보행자가 좀 더 쾌적하고 안전하게 이동할 수 있고, 휴식과 문화생활이 가능한 생활공간으로 가로공간의 기능을 개선할 수 있는 방안을 제시하는데 있다.  (연구방법) 첫째, 가로공간의 정의 및 범위에 대한 일반적인 인식을 살펴보고 가로공간의 개념을 재정립 한다. 둘째, 국내 가로공간 유형의 분류체계와 공간구조, 시설물 설치 현황에 대하여 기능적 측면에서 조사·분석하여 평면적인 공간 및 시설물 계획으로 인한 국내 가로공간의 문제점을 해결할 수 있는 방안으로 통합디자인 개념 도입의 필요성을 제시한다. 셋째, 가로공간 통합디자인의 개념 및 범위를 설명하고, 다양한 가로공간의 유형 중 사람들의 일상생활과 가장 밀접한 가로공간을 대상으로 통합디자인의 실천 수단인 디자인가이드라인을 제시한다.  (결과) 본 연구는 국내 가로공간에서 나타나는 기능적 측면의 문제점들을 해결하고, 가로공간이 본연의 기능을 수행할 수 있도록 기능성을 개선하는 방법의 하나로서 이용자와 공간, 이용자와 시설물 상호간의 관계성을 통합적 관점에서 고려한 통합디자인 개념을 가로를 설계하는 초기단계부터 도입할 것을 제안한다. 가로공간 통합디자인은 보행자를 위한 쾌적한 보행 유효 폭 확보와 시설물의 과도한 중복설치를 방지하고, 가로공간의 기능성을 개선시키는 대안이 될 수 있다.  (결론) 기 조성된 가로공간의 대부분은 무분별하게 조성 및 설치되는 공간과 시설물들로 인해 최소한의 보행 유효 폭마저 확보되지 못해 가장 통행공간으로서의 기능조차 제공되지 못하고 있다. 가로공간 통합디자인은 이러한 문제를 해결할 수 있는 실효성 있는 방법 중의 하나이다. 통합디자인 개념의 도입은 이용자 측면에서는 쾌적한 보행 및 공간환경이 확보되고, 도시적 측면에서는 조화로운 가로경관을 조성할 수 있는 긍정적인 결과를 기대할 수 있다. 또한 통합디자인 개념이 국내에 안정적으로 도입되기 위해서는 공공부문뿐만 아니라 가로공간과 접한 공개공지 등과 같은 민간부문의 적극 참여를 유도할 수 있는  방안 마련을 위한 지속적인 연구가 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNG 버스의 보급률이 계속적으로 증가하고 있으며 이에 대한 엄격한 배기규제를 충족시키고 경제적인 후처리장치의 연구개발이 필요하다. 장기적인 연구로는, CNG 버스에서 배출되는 유독성가스인 CH₄와 NOx를 동시저감시키는 새로운 NGOC/LNT+NGOC/SCR 복합시스템을 개발하는 것이다. 이 연구는 복합시스템 후단에 장착되는 선택적인촉매환원(SCR)의 washcoat를 세라믹과 메탈 담체에 코팅하여 de-CH₄/NOx 특성을 파악하는 것이다. V, Cu-SCR 촉매는 CH₄ 산화반응에는 영향을 미치지 않고, 이중층으로 코팅된 2, 4번 NGOC/SCR 촉매는 400℃에서 CH₄가 산화되기 시작하여 약 550℃에서는 약 20% 수준으로 CH₄가 저감되었다. NGOC/SCR처럼 two layer로 코팅된 2, 4번 SCR 촉매는 350℃이상에서는 마이너스(-) NOx 전환률을 나타냈다. 이는 NH₄NO₃(질산염)으로 흡장되어 있는 NOx가 촉매의 반응속도가 저하됨에 따라 N₂로 환원되지 못하고 NO+NO₂로 탈착되었기 때문이다. 세라믹 기반의 복합시스템은 400℃에서 약 30%, 500℃에서 LOT50에 이르러 메탈 기반의 복합시스템보다 약 20% CH4 정화 성능이 높았고, NGOC/LNT+Cu-SCR 복합시스템 조합이 적합하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cape Town 협약은 고가의 특정한 이동장비에 대해 체약국 간에 공인된 국제담보권을 창설하였다. 협약의 국제담보권은 채무불이행 또는 도산 상태 발생 시 우선권을 가진다.
  협약은 협약 그 자체와 특정 장비를 규율하는 의정서라는 이원적 구조로 구성되어 있다. 그러므로 협약은 새로운 의정서를 도입하여 새로운 장비로 협약의 적용대상을 쉽게 확장할 수 있다. 현재까지 항공기의정서, 철도차량의정서, 우주자산의정서가 성안되었다. 
  이제 UNIDROIT는 건설장비, 농업장비, 광업장비를 규율하는 네 번째 의정서에 관한 작업을 진행하고 있다. 최근에는 “건설장비, 농업장비, 광업장비에 특정된 문제에 대한 이동장비에 관한 국제담보권 협약 의정서(MAC 의정서)” 예비초안이 작성되었다. MAC의정서는 다양한 장비들을 목적물로 하기 때문에 목적물 장비를 어떻게 정의할 것인지, 그 범위를 어떻게 한정할 것인지가 문제되었다. MAC의정서는 이 문제를 HS code를 도입하는 방식으로 해결하였다. 한편, 기존 의정서와 달리 MAC의정서에서 규율하는 어떤 장비들은 부동산과 결합되어 이용된다는 문제가 있었다. 많은 국가들의 국내법에서 부동산에 설정된 권리는 이에 결합된 동산에 확장된다. 이 경우 협약상의 국제담보권과 부동산에 설정된 권리 간의 우선순위가 문제될 수 있다. MAC의정서는 체약국이 선택할 수 있는 세 가지 대안을 제시하고 있다. 우리나라가 이 의정서에 가입한다면 우리 민법 제256조, 제260조, 제358조와의 충돌을 피하기 위해 대안 B 또는 C를 선택해야 할 것이다.
  우리나라에는 이미 건설기계에 저당권 설정을 인정하는 자동차 등 특정동산 저당법 이 있다. 이 특별법과 MAC의정서는 유사점이 있고, 따라서 Cape Town 협약 및 MAC의정서는 우리 법제상 수용 가능하다. 
  MAC의정서는 산업기반시설 구축과 식량안보와 관련하여 의미 있는 경제적 이익을 가져다 줄 것으로 기대된다. 이미 두 차례 정부전문가 회의가 열렸고, 주요 선진국들은 적극적으로 새로운 의정서에 관한 의견을 표명하고 있다. 우리나라도 MAC의정서 예비초안을 면밀히 검토하고, 새로운 의정서 도입 작업이 완료되기 전에 우리의 의견을 표명할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2010년대의 일본 자동차 기업의 높은 성과는 이들 혁신활동이 원동력이 되었다고 평가할 수 있다. 다른 하나의 커다란 변화는 개발 방식의 혁신이다. 종래에는 차종별 최적화 설계가 개발의 중심이었는데 이를 모듈 설계 방식으로 바꿔 차종, 나아가 세그멘트를 횡단하여 설계의 전체 최적화를 추구하고 있다는 점이 가장 큰 특징이다. 이를 통해 개발 생산성을 높이고 개발 기간을 단축하는 것이 가능하게 되고, 부품 원가를 큰 폭으로 삭감하여 결과적으로 차량가격의 대폭적인 절감을 실현할 수게 된다. 일본 자동차 기업의 사례는 객관적 상황의 악화나 위기의 국면에서 어떻게 대응해야 되는가에 대한 하나의 전형적인 모델을 제시해 준다. 구조조정이나 정리해고와 같은 방식에 의존하지 않고서도 조직 능력을 강화하고 체질을 개선해서 어려운 상황을 극복해낼 수 있다는 가능성과 유효성을 보여 주는 사례이다. 이 점은 한국 자동차 기업에도 커다란 시사를 준다고 생각된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

실증적 분석의 결과는 1계층 총 3개의 평가기준에 대한 가중치, 그리고 2계층 총 9개의 하위 평가항목에 대한 가중치로 각각 제시되었다. 1계층 평가기준에 대한 가중치는 기업 내부적 및 외부적 정보이전, 기업 내부적 조직구조, 기업 외부적 협력의 순으로 밝혀졌다. 2계층 총 9개의 평가항목 중에서 신제품 개발과 관련된 효율적 정보관리, 변화와 혁신에 대한 기업 전체 조직의 탁월한 유연성, 신제품 개발과 관련된 기업 내부적 정보이전의 원활성, 신제품 개발과 관련된 기업 외부적 정보이전의 원활성 등의 순으로 가중치가 높은 것으로 확인되었다.
본 연구에서는 1계층 평가기준에 속한 2계층 평가항목이 각각 3개로 동일하지만 결과에 대한 신뢰성을 높이고, 결과에 대한 보다 심층적인 해석을 하기 위해 크루스칼-왈리스 검정을 실시하였다. 검정 결과, 1계층 평가기준의 가중치 순위는 반전이 없이 동일한 것으로 나타났지만, 유의확률은 0.113으로 유의수준 0.1에서 1계층의 세 평가기준 간 유의한 차이가 없는 것으로 밝혀졌다. 그러므로 이러한 검정 결과에 기초하여 1계층 평가기준별로 가장 가중치가 높은 2계층 평가항목이 의사결정을 위해 우선적으로 검토되어야 한다. 즉, 기업 내부적 조직구조에서는 9개 평가항목 중 2순위에 해당되는 변화와 혁신에 대한 기업 전체 조직의 탁월한 유연성이, 기업 외부적 협력에서는 9개 평가항목 중 6순위에 해당되는 신제품의 부품을 납품하는 공급업체의 품질향상이, 그리고 기업 내부적 및 외부적 정보이전에서는 9개 평가항목 중 1순위에 해당되는 신제품 개발과 관련된 효율적 정보관리가 각각 의사결정을 위해 우선적으로 고려되어야 한다.

□ 자동차사고 관련 배상책임은 자배법에 따라 보유자가 부담하는 운행자책임, 민법상 불법행위 규정에 따라 운전자가 부담하는 운전자책임, 제조물책임법에 따라 제작사가 부담하는 제조물책임으로 나뉘어짐

ㆍ 운행자책임은 운전 여부나 과실 여부에 관계없이 자동차의 운행과 사고 사이에 인과관계가 있으면 인정되는 무과실에 가까운 책임임
□ 레벨3 상용화에 대비한 배상책임법제는 레벨3의 과도기적 특성 및 일반차 사고와 구별되는 자율주행차 사고 고유의 특성을 고려하여 마련되어야 함
ㆍ 레벨3는 완전자율주행으로 가기 위한 과도기적 단계로 완전자율주행차 전면상용화 이전까지는 여러 레벨의 자율주행차와 일반차가 도로에 혼재된 상태에서 다양한 형태의 사고가 발생하게 될 것임
ㆍ 또한, 자율주행사고의 경우 운전자책임이 성립되지 않고, 제조물책임이 인정될 가능성이 높아지며, 다양한 사고원인이 개입될 가능성이 있는 만큼 사고원인 규명이 중요해질 것임

  해외의 관련 사례를 살펴보면 이미 많은 국가에서 우리나라 보다 어린 청소년들에게 운전을 허용하고 있다. 물론 10대들의 사고에 대한 논란이 있지만 해당 국가들의 전반적인 교통사고 발생건수는 오히려 낮은 것도 사실이다.
  본 연구에서는 우리나라의 운전면허 취득 최소연령 기준을 지금 보다 낮출 것을 제안하였다. 대형차량에 대해서는 운전면허 취득 최소연령을 기존 19세에서 18세로 낮추고, 중소형차량에 대해서는 기존 18세에서 16세로 낮춘다.
  〈표 본문 참조〉
  
  어린 10대 운전자들의 교통사고를 예방하기 위해 운전면허 취득 과정에서 성인보다는 교통안전교육이나 기능교육을 강화하도록 한다. 또한 만18세 이상이 되기 전의 운전면허에는 심야시간 운행금지와 20세 미만 동승금지 등의 제한을 설정하도록 하였다.
  〈10대 운전면허 운행 제한〉
  ? 18세 이전까지 다음의 행위를 금지한다.
  - 새벽 0시부터 새벽 5시까지의 야간 운전
  - 보호자(운전면허 취득 5년 이상 된 성인) 동승 없이 20세 미만을 태우는 행위
  ※ 현행 연습면허의 동승자 기준은 운전경험 2년 이상인 성인임

  운전면허 취득 최소연령이 완화되면 청소년들은 지금보다 자유로운 이동권을 선택할 수 있어 이동편의가 증진될 것으로 기대된다. 특히 대중교통 서비스가 열악한 지역의 청소년들의 통학 불편에 기여할 수 있다. 청소년들의 운전허용은 통학 뿐만 아니라 아르바이트나 성인시기에 구직 활동에도 도움이 될 것이다. 논란의 소지는 있지만 장기적으로는 청소년기 경험으로 사회전체의 교통안전 의식을 높여 전체 교통사고를 줄일 수도 있다. 무엇보다 오토바이 이용에 따른 청소년 사상자를 줄일 수 있다.
  청소년들의 운전허용은 여러 가지 긍정적인 효과가 있음에도 불구하고 10대들의 교통사고 증가에 대한 우려와 가정의 경제력에 따른 양극화 등의 사회 문제도 가지고 있다. 따라서 대상 주체인 청소년들의 의견뿐만 아니라 부모를 포함한 전문학계 등의 합의된 의견이 필요하다. 지금까지는 단순히 어린 나이의 운전자는 사고위험이 높다는 인식으로 인해 논의조차 되지 못했지만 우리나라도 이 문제에 대해 사회적 공론화가 필요한 것이다. 공론화 과정에서 청소년들의 면허에 대한 동승의 무화, 통행시간 제약 등의 제한에 대한 검토가 자연스럽게 이뤄질 것으로 기대된다.
  또한 자율주행자동차 시대에 대비해 청소년 운전면허를 포함한 전반적인 운전면허 제도에 대한 큰 틀에서의 제도 개선도 추진해야 한다. 그리고 최근 공유경제의 한 분야로 확산되고 있는 카쉐어링 분야에도 청소년들의 접근이 가능하도록 제도화 되어야 된다. 가정 경제 수준에 따른 차량 이용의 불평등을 완화하기 위해서는 카쉐어링의 활용이 필요하기 때문이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1920년대 도시인구가 밀집되고 화재가 빈발하면서 화재를 효과적으로 진압할 수 있는 자동차 펌프가 도입되었다. 자동차펌프는 최신장비였기에 펌프장비를 작동할 수 있는 전문화된 상비소방수가 필요하였다. 소방업무를 통일적으로 다룰 수 있는 관서의 필요성에 따라 경성소방서도 1925년에 開署되었다.
경성소방서의 開署를 계기로 소방업무는 상비화로 접어들었다. 1935년 중반에는 소방조 산하에 수방단이 결성되었다. 수방단은 장마 홍수기에는 수난 구조활동을 하였다. 수방단은 여름에 활동하였지만 수방단장을 비롯한 수방단원들은 소방조원들이 겸직하였다.
1937년 중일전쟁이 발발하여 전쟁국면이 조성되면서 일제는 소방조 · 수방단 · 방호단을 묶어 경방단을 만들었다. 경방단이 만들어지면서 소방조도 경방단 소방부로 개편되었다. 그러나 경방단에서 가장 중추적인 역할을 담당한 기구는 소방부였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,의학에서 인공지능 도입의 현재와 미래 = The Present and Future of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,"인공지능, 왓슨, 인공지능 의학, 미래의학, 의료윤리","지난 2016년 이세돌 9단을 꺾은 알파고 사건은 인공지능의 미래에 대한 기대와 우려가 섞인 시대적 감정을 함축적으로 잘 보여준다. 인공지능은 인간의 단일 신경을 흉내 내는 정도였지만, 이제는 인간의 신경망을 모사할 수 있는 수준에 이르렀다. 기하급수적으로 증가한 컴퓨팅 파워를 만나 인공지능은 그 영역을 한층 더 확대했으며 의학의 영역에도 진입하게 되었다. 만약 인공지능 기반 진단의 정확도가 사람보다 높아지게 된다면, 진단의 권한은 사람으로부터 인공지능 기반의 진단으로 이양되는 것이 근거기반의학(Evidence Based Medicine)을 견지하고 있는 의학의 선택이 될 가능성이 크다. 나아가 의학이라는 학문 내에서 인공지능의 진단이나 치료가 인간 의사 보다 뛰어나다 혹은 더 정확하다는 것이 입증 되는 순간이 오면 의사의 주의의무의 규범적인 수준도 변화하게 될 것이다. 그렇다면 인공지능을 인간으로 혹은 의술을 행하는 주체로서 인식할 것인가. 인공지능이 과연 잘못된 시술에 대해 책임을 질 수 있는 법적 주체가 될 수 있을 것인지 여부가 문제될 것이다. 현대적 기술이 복합적으로 통합되어 작동하는 자동차의 사례를 살펴보면, 의사결정에 준하는 지능형 작업 수행과정에서 문제가 발생하더라고 그 서비스나 자동차가 스스로 사고에 대한 책임을 지지 않는다. 즉 기계가 인간의 의지를 정확히 인지 못한 경우 혹은 정확한 수행을 못한 경우에도 그 사고에 대한 책임은 주로 제조사가 진다. 지금과 같이 지능을 정의하기도 어렵고, 또 인공지능을 정의하기는 더욱 어렵고 모호할 때에 이를 대상으로 하는 인공지능의 법률적 주체 인식 문제를 논의하는 것은 논리적인 설득력을 유지하기 힘들다고 본다. 한편, 인공지능의 의학 도입을 통해 얻을 수 있을 것으로 예상되는 편익은 Human Error로부터의 해방, 비용감소와 의료의 질 향상, 의료불균형의 개선 등을 들 수 있다. 하지만, 앞으로 인공지능이 미래에 가져올 빛이 큰 만큼 그 그림자 역시 짙을 수 있다. 인공지능의 보급이 확대되면서 프로그래밍을 모르는 일반인도 가짜 정보의 짜깁기와 확산에 가담할 수 있게 된 것과 같이 잘못된 의료정보가 인공지능 서비스를 타고 더 쉽고 빠르게 퍼져나갈 수도 있을 것이다. 또 인간만이 할 수 있다고 여겨지던 병간호, 진료, 약조제와 복약지도 등을 인공지능이 대신하여도 그 서비스를 제공하는 것이 인간인지 인공지능인지를 구분하기 어렵게 되면, 인간 상호간의 유대관계와 그 가치는 떨어질 수밖에 없을 것이다. 나아가 현재 인공지능은 인간 지능의 일부 기능을 모사하는 수준에 머무르고 있지만, 향후 스스로 존재할 수 있는 신과 같은 개념의 인공지능이 출현하였을 때 인간 생명을 관장하는 역할을 가진 자아 의지를 가진 인공지능을 가정하면 이러한 기술을 계속해서 발전시키는 것이 과연 옳은 것인지에 대한 고민을 떨쳐버릴 수 없다. 하지만 평소 여러 가지 문제만 일으키던 피노키오가 창조주인 제페토 할아버지를 위험에서 구했던 것처럼, 앞으로 인공지능이 의학에 도입 과정에는 여러 문제점들이 따르겠지만 이를 잘 극복해 인류를 구하는 모험을 이어가기를 소망한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

① 글로벌 투자은행(IB)을 중심으로 중국 경제성장의 둔화 가능성이 제기되고 있는 가운데 대내외 하방리스크 요인을 유의할 필요가 있다. 64개 글로벌 투자은행(IB)에 따르면 중국 경제성장률(평균 전망치)은 2018년 6.5%, 2019년 6.3%로 둔화될 것으로 전망하고 있다. 다만 중국 정부의 적극적인 대응 등이 성장폭 둔화를 상쇄시킬 요인으로 작용할 가능성도 상존하고 있다. 산업 경쟁력 강화를 위한 정부의 적극적인 정책 추진, 실 수요자 기반의 부동산 투자 및 지급준비율 인하 정책 등은 내수부문의 경기 안정 기대요인이다. 하지만 기업 디폴트 리스크 확대와 미·중 간 통상 분쟁 심화 등은 대내외 리스크를 확대시키는 요인으로 작용할 가능성이 높다. ② 중국의 차세대 정보기술 산업, 자동차, 의료 산업 등은 정부 주도의 제조 산업 육성 정책에 따라 성장세가 급속히 확대되고 있는 상황이다. 중국의 공업생산총부가가치 성장률(전년동기 대비)이 10%를 상회하는 산업은 정보통신 및 전자기기, 자동차, 의료 제조 산업인 것으로 분석되었다. 이들 산업은 중국 정부가 집중적으로 추진 중에 있는 제조업 업그레이드 전략인 ‘중국 제조 2025’ 정책의 근간이 되고 있는 산업이다. 전자정보통신, 의료, 신소재 등 하이테크 고부가가치 산업의 경쟁력은 세계 최고 기술 수준에 빠르게 근접하고 있는 상황이다. 특히, 전자정보통신 산업의 경우 2014년 대비 2016년 최고기술국(미국)과의 기술격차가 0.8년으로 가장 빠르게 단축되고 있는 가운데 의료, 나노소재 산업 등도 기술 경쟁력 수준이 크게 향상되고 있는 모습이다. ③ 최근 중국의 부동산 개발 및 투자는 서민들을 위한 선별적인 토지개발 및 투자 중심으로 이루어지고 있다. 중국 보장성주택 토지공급은 2015년 연간 9,500ha에서 2017년 5,139ha로 연속 감소하였는데, 2018년 상반기에는 2,700ha(전년동기 대비 30.2% 증가)를 기록하면서 다시 증가 추세이다. 전체 부동산개발투자 중에서 주택개발투자가 차지하는 비중도 최근에는 70.2%까지 상승하면서 실거주 수요를 만족하기 위한 투자가 빠르게 확대되는 추세이다. 주택 공실면적도 해소 추세인데, 2015년 말 기준 4.52억 ㎡에 달하던 공실면적은 2018년 6월말 현재 2.74억 ㎡로, 3년도 채 안 되는 사이 1.78억 ㎡의 공실면적이 해소되었다. 부동산 재고해소에 필요한 시간(재고소진주기)도 2014년 6.5년에서 2017년 5.0년으로 크게 줄었다. 특히, 중국의 1선 특대도시인 선전(深?)은 2035년까지의 주택공급 계획물량 중에서 60%를 보장성주택으로 공급할 계획이다. ④ 중국은 최근 기업부문의 유동성 부족 우려가 나타나고 있어 은행권 지급준비율을 인하하여 선별적으로 중소기업을 지원하고 있다. 중국의 단기 정책금리(역RP금리 7일물)와 시중금리(SHIBOR 1년물)의 차이가 2016년 말 1.12%p에서 2017년 말 2.26%p, 2018년 6월말 1.83%p를 나타내면서 최근 자금조달 여력이 부족한 중소기업의 대출 이자부담이 급격히 증가했다. 선별적으로 중소기업의 유동성을 지원하기 위해 중국은 2018년 4월과 7월 두 차례에 걸쳐 대형상업은행, 중소형상업은행, 농촌상업은행의 지급준비율을 1.5%p 인하하여 유동성을 공급했다. 확대된 유동성은 은행이 대출채권을 주식으로 전환하기 위한 자금으로 주로 활용되어 중소 기업부문의 부채 감축에 기여할 것으로 예상된다. ⑤ 최근 기업 디폴트 사례가 급증하면서 회사채 금리가 급등하는 등 기업부문의 리스크 확산 우려가 가중되고 있다. 2018년 6월 5일까지 기준 중국 내 회사채 부도 규모는 142억 위안(약 2조 3,810억 원)으로, 2017년 연간규모의 60% 수준에 육박하면서 빠르게 확대되었다. 동 기준 회사채 부도율은 0.53%로, 2017년의 0.46%를 넘어섰고 2016년의 0.66%에 육박했다. 기업의 건전성에 대한 불신이 증폭되면서 지난해 연평균 4.71% 수준이던 최우량(AAA등급) 기업 회사채 금리는 올해 들어 평균 5.09% 수준으로 상승했다. 이에 따라, 은행권에 대한 접근성이 떨어지는 기업들은 만기도래 채무상환이 더 어려워지고 있다. ⑥ 미·중 간 통상 분쟁으로 중국 10대 전략 산업 분야가 직접적인 영향을 받을 것으로 예상되며, 향후 보복관세 부과 품목 범위는 확대될 가능성도 상존한다. 2018년 4월 3일 미국의 對 중국 464억 달러규모의 수입품에 25% 관세부과 발표로 시작된 미중 통상 분쟁은 양국의 보복관세 부과로 격화되는 모양새다. 특히 미국이 발효한 수입액 기준 464억 규모의 관세부과 대상 품목에는 에너지 및 원자력 등 기계류가 43.2%, 전기기기가 31.2%, 광학 및 사진, 의료기기가 13.9% 등으로 첨단 산업 분야가 높은 비중을 차지하고 있는데, 이는 중국 정부가 제조업 육성 정책으로 추진 중에 있는 ‘중국 제조 2025’의 10대 산업이 집중적으로 포함되어 있다. 미·중 간 통상 분쟁이 장기화될 경우 중국이 집중 육성 중인 주요 제조 산업의 경쟁력 약화가 우려된다. ‘중국 제조 2025’ 10대 육성 산업과 관세부과 품목은 알루미늄을 제외한 나머지 분야에서 연관성이 높아 관련 산업의 對美 수출 감소가 예상되는 상황이다. 종합적으로 봤을 때, 최근 중국경제가 비교적 안정적인 성장이 지속되고 있으나, 미·중 간 통상 분쟁 격화, 기업부채 확산 등 대내외 리스크가 커질 경우 향후 성장률 둔화가 우려된다. 이에 한국 경제는 향후 미·중 통상 분쟁에 따른 對 중국 수출 충격이 예상되나, 이로 인한 중국 제조업 경쟁력 위축이 가시화된다면 우리의 산업 경쟁력 제고를 위한 기회요인으로 작용할 가능성도 상존한다.
■ 시사점
올해 중국 경제의 성장속도가 다소 느려지는 가운데 기업부문의 부실, 對美 통상분쟁 악화 등 대내·외 리스크가 상존하는 만큼 이에 대한 대응책이 필요하나 이로 인한 기회요인 활용도 모색해야 한다. 첫째, 중국 정부의 적극적인 제조업 육성 정책 추진으로 10대 전략 산업의 글로벌 경쟁력 수준은 빠르게 상승하고 있어, 한국의 주력 산업 경쟁력 강화 방안 마련이 절실하다. 둘째, 부동산 공급정책이 수요자 맞춤형으로 이루어져 건설, 기계, 부동산 등 연관 산업의 변화가 예상되는 만큼 이에 대한 대응책 마련이 필요하다. 셋째, 인민은행의 지급준비율 인하에도 불구하고 중국의 구조조정 과정에서 발생 가능한 돌발 금융리스크에도 대비할 필요성이 있다. 넷째, 미·중 통상 분쟁에 따른 중국의 對한국 기술추격이 약화될 가능성을 활용해 국내 첨단 제조업 경쟁력 제고의 기회로 삼아야 할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

다음으로 당대의 다양한 문화를 엿볼 수 있었다. <예수나미덧더면>에서는 우리나라에 기독교가 유입되면서 기독교 문화와 교리(敎理)가 매우 긍정적으로 작용했던 것을 알 수 있었다. 즉 예수나 믿었더라면 천당에 갈 것인데, 광산에서 얌전하지 못한 노릇을 해서 불량분자가 된 것을 후회하였던 것이다. <밀매노래>와 <베틀가>에서 민중들의 농촌문화, <장타령>을 통하여 민중들의 상업문화를 포착할 수 있었다. 또한 <우리?품행이얼마나방정한지>에서 민중들의 빈궁한 삶의 모습, 즉 생활문화를 살필 수 있었다.
마지막으로 당대의 다양한 풍속을 파악할 수 있었다. 즉 1920년대 당시 농촌의풍속이 잘 드러난 <사승노래(삼 삼는 노래)>, 민속놀이를 할 때 부르는 <놋다리노래(답교가)>와 <기와 노래(와가)>에서도 당시 민중들의 풍속을 알 수 있었다.
이 논의를 통해 1920년대 신문과 잡지에 수록된 민요 사설의 일면을 살필 수 있었다. 이는 우리나라에 당대 신문물이 유입되면서 부정적인 측면과 함께 신문물을 수용할 수밖에 없었던 농민들의 마음과 다양한 문화와 풍속을 포착했다는 점에서 의의가 있다고 하겠다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

미국의 사례에서 다음과 같은 시사점이 도출된다. 첫째, 초미세먼지의 대기 중 농도를 낮추기 위해서는 원인물질의 배출규제를 강화해야 한다. 둘째, 배출권거래제와 연계된 총량규제를 화력발전소, 제철?제련소, 정유?정제시설 등 오염물질의 배출량이 많고 규모의 경제가 가능한 산업시설을 대상으로 시행하여야 한다. 셋째, 이산화탄소 등 온실가스의 배출량을 억제하기 위한 적극적인 기후변화정책을 수립?시행해야 한다. 특히 전력산업에 대한 총량규제의 시행은 친환경적인 에너지기술의 개발?보급?이용을 촉진하는 에너지정책과의 유기적인 연계성이 확보되어야 한다. 넷째, 경유차에 대한 배기가스규제를 엄격하게 시행하면서 자동차의 연비기준을 강화하여 친환경자동차의 개발 및 보급을 촉진하여야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,트럼프의 미국 우선주의 통상정책과 EU의 양면적 대응 = Trump’s ‘America First’ Trade Policy and the EU’s Two-fold Responses,"미국 우선주의 무역정책,보호무역주의,EU,미중 무역전쟁,관세,America first trade policy,Protectionism,EU,Trade War between the US and China,Tariff","본 연구는 트럼프 정부의 미국 우선주의 무역정책에 대한 EU의 대응방안을 분석하고 그 시사점을 제시하는데 목적이 있다. 트럼프 행정부는 국가 안보를 위협할 수 있다는 근거로 미국으로 수입되는 철강과 알루미늄에 각각 25%와 10%의 추가 관세를 부과하기로 하였고, 이에 영향을 받는 국가들과 개별적으로 협상을 진행하였다. EU를 중심으로 캐나다, 멕시코, 중국 등이 강경 대응 방침을 밝혔으나 대다수의 국가들이 미국과의 협상을 통해 문제를 해결하는 방식으로 대응하고 있다. 미중간의 무역 전쟁이 심화되는 상황에서 EU도 EU로 수입되는 미국산 제품에 대한 보복관세 부과를 결정하였고, 이에 대해 미국은 EU산 자동차에 대한 추가 관세 부과를 위협하는 등 미국과 EU의 무역 분쟁도 심화될 가능성이 높았다. EU는 미국에 대한 강경 대응책을 시행함과 동시에 지속적인 협상을 벌여 2018년 7월 추가적인 조치를 취하지 않으면서 자동차 산업을 제외한 분야에서 관세, 비관세장벽 및 보조금을 철폐하고, 서비스 분야 등에서의 교역 확대 및 WTO 개혁 방안 을 논의하기로 합의하였다.
미국의 보호무역주의정책에 대한 EU의 대응 정책은 양면적인 특징―강경책과 온건책의 병행―을 가지고 있다. EU는 무역과 관련하여 28개 회원국을 대표하는 권한을 가지고 있으며 미국을 넘어서는 교역 규모 등이 EU의 강경 대응을 가능하게 한다. 물론 EU가 WTO를 중심으로 하는 다자주의 차원의 자유 교역을 대외 무역정책의 원칙으로 하고 있다는 점에서 미국에 대한 보복정책도 국제 통상 규범에 기초를 두고 시행되었다. 아울러 미국의 위협이 지속되는 한 미국과의 협상은 불가하다는 입장을 보이면서, 미국과의 무역 분쟁에 대한 EU의 확고한 원칙을 제시하고 있다. 그러나 EU는 미국과의 경제적, 그리고 정치적 관계의 중요성 등을 고려하고 미국과의 전면적인 무역 전쟁으로 인한 피해가 클 수밖에 없다는 점에서 미국과의 협상을 통한 문제 해결에도 주력하는 모습을 보여 왔다. 특히 미국의 주요 표적이 독일이라는 점에 회원국 사이에서 결속력의 문제가 발생할 수 있으며, 중국이 미국의 보호무역주의에 대항하기 위한 협력을 제안한 것을 거절하면서 오히려 미국의 중국 교역 관행에 대한 비판에 동의하고 있다.
미국과 EU 양측은 일단 협상을 진행하고 있지만 현재 미국의 추가 관세 부과와 EU의 보복 관세 조치가 시행 중이며, 협상에서 다루어질 분야들이 합의에 이르기 쉽지 않은 만큼 미국과 EU 사이에 무역 분쟁이 심화될 가능성은 남아 있는 상태이다. 협상의 결과가 어떠한 식으로 결정되든 확실한 점은 국제 교역 질서의 재편이 불가피하며, 미중 무역 전쟁의 지속과 미국과 EU의 협상 결과에 따라 공급사슬의 변화도 불가피하다는 점이다. 이러한 다양한 상황을 고려하여 한국은 중장기적 관점에서 대응 정책을 수립할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,음파를 이용한 연소 안정성 개선에 관한 연구,"NOx Level,Exhaust Gas Recirculation,Sonic Wave,Fuel Droplet,Combustion Stability","자동차에서 배출되는 배기가스 중 질소산화물은 요사이 문제가 되는 미세먼지의 주요 요인 중 하나이다. 질소산화물(NOx)은 고온 조건에서 연소가 진행될 때 발생하므로 연소시 온도를 낮추는 방법으로 발생을 억제하고 있다. 자동차에서는 일반적으로 배기가스 재순환(EGR)을 사용하여 연소 온도를 낮추는 방법으로 감소시킨다. 그러나 EGR 비율이 높아질수록 NOx의 양은 저감되나 연소 안정성의 하락으로 인한 불완전연소 가능성의 증가로 일산화탄소와 미연탄화수소의 양이 증가하여 오히려 오염물질이 증가하는 문제를 발생시킬 수 있다. 여기에서는 연료 입자에 음파를 조사하여 연료 입자의 운동성을 향상시켜 연소가 원활히 진행되게 하여 연소의 안정성을 향상시키는 방안에 대하여 해석적 및 실험적 방법으로 연구하였다. 해석적 방법으로는 유동해석 소프트웨어를 사용하여 연료 입자에 다양한 주파수의 음파를 조사하여 연료 입자의 움직임 변화에 대한 연구를 진행하였다. 해석 결과, 작은 연료 입자의 조건에서는 고주파의 음파에 의해 영향을 많이 받고, 연료 입자가 큰 조건에서는 저주파의 음파에 의해 영향을 많이 받아 운동성이 증가함을 알 수 있었다. 실험적 방법으로는 연소실을 구성하여 정해진 당량비 조건에서 연소시키며 다양한 주파수의 음파를 조사하며 연소실내 압력을 측정하는 연구를 진행하였다. 측정된 압력으로부터 열방출량을 계산하면 연소의 진행 상황에 대한 정보를 얻을 수 있는데, 실험 결과 초기 연소시 상대적 저주파 조사 조건에서 열방출량이 증가한 것을 확인할 수 있었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,자율주행에서의 제조물책임에 관한 몇 가지 법률문제 = Autonomes Fahren : Einige Probleme der Produkthaftung,"자율주행 자동차,소프트웨어,제조물책임,제조물관찰의무,운행자책임,Fahzeug,Software,Produkhaftung,Produktbeobachtungspficht,Halterhaftung","자율주행차의 보급은 안전을 크게 제고하여 교통사고에 대한 책임법의 의의는 전반적으로 감소할 것이나, 그럼에도 자율주행차로 인한 사고를 완전히 배제할 수는 없다. 이에 본 연구는 현행 제조물책임법이 자율주행차로 인한 사고에 대하여 적절히 대처할 수 있는지 몇 가지 관점에서 고찰하였으며, 그 주요 결과는 다음과 같다. 먼저 전통적 의미의 제조물이라고 할 수 없는 인공지능(소프트웨어)에 대하여 제조물책임법이 적용될 수 있는지 검토하였다. 하드웨어와 소프트웨어가 통합된 제품은 물론 온라인으로 다운로드되는 소프트웨어도 동산으로 파악하여 제조물책임법이 적용된다고 해석할 것이다. 다만 소비자가 소프트웨어를 다운로드하여 그것을 지속적으로 사용함이 없이 소프트웨어와 정보기술(IT) 인프라를 외부 서비스제공자로부터 제공받아 일시적으로 사용할 수 있을 뿐인 소프트웨어(SaaS)는 제조물책임법에 따른 제조물이라고 할 수 없다.
  제조물책임에서는 잠재적 책임주체와 복수의 책임주체 사이의 관계 내지 책임분배가 명확히 이루어져야 한다. 제조물책임법은 제조업자 개념을 본래적 의미의 제조업자를 넘어서 확대하였기 때문이다. 제조물의 제작과정에 참여한 자는 물론 수입업자나 표시제조업자를 제조업자 개념에 포함시킨 것은 피해자가 본래 책임을 져야 할 자를 특정할 필요가 없도록 만들어 피해자를 두텁게 보호하기 위한 것이다. 소프트웨어 공급자가 책임을 져야 하는 경우 피해자에 대하여 최종제조물의 제조업자와 동일한 범위의 책임을 진다. 원재료나 부품에 결함이 있는 경우, 그 원재료나 부품의 공급자 외에 결함 있는 원재료나 부품이 통합되어 있는 최종제조물의 제조업자도 책임을 진다. 제조물책임법에 따른 손해배상책임을 배제하거나 제한하는 특약은 소비자에 대한 관계에서는 무효이지만, 그럼에도 최종제조업자와 원재료 또는 부품의 공급자 사이의 내부적 구상에서는 양자 사이에 (약관을 통해) 체결된 책임에 관한 약정의 내용이 중요하다.
  제조업자의 주의의무는 공급시점을 넘어 제조물관찰의무의 형태로 확장된다. 차량에 학습능력을 가지고 계속하여 진화하는 알고리즘이 탑재되어 있는 경우 제조업자가 차량을 집중적으로 관찰할 의무가 있는지, 그리고 위험방지를 위하여 어떤 조치를 취해야 하는지가 문제된다. 일정 수준 이상의 복잡성을 가진 소프트웨어는 무결함을 보장할 수 없다는 점, 소프트웨어 결함은 통상적으로 유통 후 사용 중에 비로소 나타난다는 점, 고도로 자동화된 주행시스템은 이제 막 상용화되기 시작하였다는 점에서 특히 세심한 제조물관찰이 필요하다. 자율주행차의 경우 일반 차량이나 그 밖의 제조물보다 제조물관찰의무가 차지하는 의미가 훨씬 커진다. 제조업자의 제조물관찰의무는 원칙적으로 자신의 제조물에 국한되지 않고 일정 범위 내에서 타사가 제작·유통시킨 제조물 또는 부속품에도 미친다고 할 것이다. 제조업자가 유통된 제조물에 의한 법익침해를 방지하기 위하여 어떤 조치를 취해야 할 것인지는 위험의 종류 및 잠재적 중대성에 비례하여 정해져야 하나, 소프트웨어 업데이트는 위험방지를 위한 유용한 조치라고 하겠다 . 소비자는 그가 계획한 용도에 적합한 차량을 선택할 부진정의무, 제조업자의 취급설명서에 따라 시스템을 구성하고 또 제조업자가 언급한 보안조치를 취해야 할 부진정의무, 정기적인 데이터 백업에 관한 부진정의무, 차량에 대한 모니터링 및 유지보수에 관한 부진정의무를 부담한다. 소비자가 제조업자의 경고에 적절히 반응하지 아니하는 등 손해를 방지하거나 경감하기 위한 필요한 조치를 소홀히 하여 손해가 발생 또는 확대된 때에도 과실상계가 따라야 한다.
  마지막으로 도로교통사고에 대한 자배법에 따른 책임(특히 운행자책임)이 향후에도 유지되어야 하는지 및 이것과 제조물책임의 관계를 살펴보았다. 우리의 경우 자배법 제3조에 따라 차량의 운행자가 차량의 운행으로 인하여 야기된 인신손해에 대하여 원칙적으로 무과실의 위험책임을 지는바, 이는 자율주행의 경우에도 달라지지 않아야 한다. 운행자책임을 완화하면서 제조물책임을 강화하는 입법은 무엇보다도 피해자보호의 관점에서 쉽게 채택할 수 있는 것이 아니다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

연구결과 : 모빌리티의 기본 개념에서 이동성 변화가 일관된 방향성을 가지기보다는, 각 모빌리티의 의미와 사용 주체의 요구에 따라 변화됨을 볼 수 있었다. 따라서 향후의 모빌리티의 특성은 내·외장 디자인에서의 시민적 무관심 개념에 대한 반영이 보다 명확해질 수 있다.
결론 : 마이크로 모빌리티와 다인승의 자율주행 모빌리티에서는 공히 시민적 무관심 개념이 실내 디자인에서 중요한 요소가 될 것이라는 시사점을 얻을 수 있었다. 그러나 이는 사회학적 측면의 고찰을 바탕으로 한 것으로, 다양한 기능과 용도의 모빌리티에 동일하게 적용되지는 않을 수 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

고속도로 운전자의 경우, 자율차 과실이 크다고 느낄수록 자율차 운전자에게 귀인하였고, 자율차 근방에서 안전운전을 해야겠다는 의향이 높았다. 그리고 악천후가 자율차 교통사고의 중요한 원인이라고 느낄수록 자율차 근방에서 안전운전을 할 의향이 높았다. 한편, 시내도로 운전자의 경우 약간 다른 양상을 보였다. 자율차 과실, 날씨 요인, 차량 문제 요인으로 인한 자율차 교통사고의 책임을 교통행정당국에 귀인하는 모습을 보였다. 고속도로 주행과 달리 시내주행에서 운전자들은 자율차 교통사고를 예방할 권능이 교통행정당국에 있다고 믿는다는 것을 반영한다.
자율차 근방에서 안전운전 의향의 종속변수가 여타의 선행변수에 별로 영향을 받지 않는 점도 인상적이다. 이것은 자율차 주행이 거의 완벽하다고 믿기 때문에 본인이 조심한다고 사고가 예방되는 여지가 적다고 인식하기 때문일 것이다. 어쩌면 자율차 교통사고는 악천후처럼 인간의 노력을 벗어난 운명적인 사안인지도 모른다. 이러한 운전자들의 인식은 자율차 교통사고를 인재가 아닌 천재로 인식할지도 모른다는 가능성을 엿보게 한다. 이러한 결과는 교통정책과 보험정책에 통찰력을 줄 수 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An idealized bushing is an elastomeric hollow cylinder between an outer steel cylindrical sleeve and an inner steel cylindrical rod. The outer sleeve is connected with the components of the suspension system and transfer forces and moments from the wheel to the chassis. The accurate determination of the transmitted forces and moments among autocomponents, the motion of the components, the stresses in the components, and energy dissipation are affected by the quality of the elastomeric bushing model. Force- Displacement relation, moment-rotational angle relation, and coupled relations for elastomeric bushings are imperative for multi-body dynamics simulations. The boundary value problem in the bushing response leads to force-displacement relation and moment-rotational angle relations which require extensive computation time for implementation. Herein, an explicit moment-rotational angle relation has been introduced for use in multi-body dynamics simulations, a modified Pipkin-Rogers model is proposed and a boundary value problem is formulated for torsional mode elastomeric bushing response. Lianis"" experimental equation and Pipkin-Rogers model are used for numerical experimental research.

2020,미국의 교통범죄처리제도 고찰 - 뉴욕주를 중심으로 - = A Study on the Traffic Crime Handling System  in the United States,"transportation crimianl law,infraction,misdemeanor,felony,New York Vehicle and Traffic Law,교통형법,범칙행위,경죄,중죄,뉴욕 자동차 및 교통법","미국은 음주운전, 무면허운전, 난폭운전 등 대부분의 교통범죄를 각 주의 교통관련법에 의해 규율하고 있다. 다만, 연방정부가 소유하거나 관리하는 지역에서의 교통위반 또는 교통범죄행위는 해당 연방법에 따라 연방법원이 관할권을 갖는다.
각 주는 교통 관련 연방기관이 제시한 기준을 바탕으로 교통위반 및 교통범죄, 교통사고 책임에 대한 규정과 처리절차를 관계법령에 규정하고 있다. 각 주는 교통 위반행위를 그 행위의 위험성과 그 행위가 도로안전에 끼칠 해악을 고려하여 교통범칙행위, 교통경죄, 교통중죄로 나누어 규정하고 있다.
범칙행위는 범죄가 아닌 일종의 제재로서 과속, 신호위반 등의 경미한 교통위반에 대한 티켓 발부 등이 해당한다. 범칙행위에 해당하는 경우, 위반 운전자는 주의 규정 또는 위반정도에 따라 우편이나 온라인으로 벌금을 납부하거나 법원에 출석하여 위반사실을 인정하고 납부하게 된다. 다만 자신의 위반사실을 부인하는 경우, 법원의 판단에 따라 정식재판에 회부할 수 있다.
교통경죄는 범칙행위보다 상대적으로 심각한 교통위반행위들을 대상으로 한다.
교통경죄의 유형은 주마다 다르지만, 도로교통안전청(NHTSA)이 최소한의 제재대상으로 정한 연방법상 행위들을 주에서 반영하지 않을 경우, 해당 주에 위치한 고속도로에 대한 보조금 지급 중단이 가능하다. 때문에 대부분 주에서 형사법적 제재를 받는 교통경죄 행위들은 대부분 음주(약물)운전, 난폭운전(reckless driving) 등을 포함하는 등 큰 차이를 보이지 않는다. 범칙행위와 달리 교통경죄에 대해서는 형사제재가 가해지기 때문에 그 유형을 주법으로 명확하게 규정하고 있지만, 사실관계를 고려하여 그 행위가 도로안전에 끼치는 위협의 정도에 근거하여 처벌의 정도를 달리하는 재량권 행사가 가능하다. 뉴욕주의 경우 난폭운전 행위는 교통경죄에 해당한다. 난폭운전에 해당하는지 판단여부는 경찰에게 상당한 재량이 주어지며, 검사가 난폭운전을 기소하기 위해서는 행위자가 이성적인 사람이라면 행하지 않을 방식으로 타인의 안전을 경시하는 행위를 했다는 사실을 법정에서 입증하여야 한다.
교통중죄는 교통위반 중 가장 중대한 위반행위이다. 대부분의 주에서는 중죄에 해당하는 경우 1년 이상의 징역과 경죄보다 높은 벌금을 병과 할 수 있게 하고 있다. 교통중죄의 유형은 주별로 차이를 보이고 있으나 일반적으로 경죄에 해당하는 위반행위가 재산상 손해·인사상·기타 중대한 피해를 발생시킨 경우 중죄로 취급된다.
대표적인 유형으로는 음주(약물)운전, 무면허운전, 난폭운전, 사고후도주, 자동차를 이용한 살인(vehicular homicide) 등을 들 수 있다. 뉴욕 형법에 규정된 대표적인 교통중죄는 운전치사죄(Vehicular Manslaughter)이다. 2급 및 1급, 가중 운전치사죄로 분류되어지는데, 모두 음주(약물) 후 운행하여 사망자가 발생하는 것을 요건으로 하고 있다.
대부분 주에서는 상습적이지 않거나, 피해가 발생하지 않은 교통법규 위반행위를 형사화하지 않으려는 노력을 하고 있다. 다만 상습적이거나 타인의 신체 및 생명에 피해를 끼친 때에는 중죄로 책임을 가중함으로써 위하의 효과를 잃지 않고 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Baek & Yoo(2018)의 연구는 신용 카드 시장에서 브랜드별 만족도와 브랜드 행복지수의 차이를 확인하지 못했다. 하지만, 자동차, 스마트폰 및 이동통신 서비스 시장에 관한 선행 연구들은 브랜드 행복지수의 차이를 확 인하였고 그 차이는 시장의 점유율 상황을 의미 있게 반영한 바 있다. 따라서 Baek & Yoo(2018)의 연구결과는 브랜드 행복지수의 역할에 대해 의문점을 제기해 준다. 우리는 신용카 드에 관한 선행 연구가 고객의 유형을 구분하지 않았기 때문에 차이를 발견하지 못했을 것이라 추론하게 되었다. 따라서 우리는 신용카드 사용자들을 신용카드 등급, 혜택에 대한 인지 여부, 가치추구성향을 기준으로 구분한 다음, 선행 연구와 같은 방식으로 브랜드 행복지수와 만족도를 측정해 브랜드별 차이를 비교해 보았다. 연구결과, 각 비교 집단 간에 브랜드 행복지수의 차이가 발견되었다. 보다 구체적으로 프리미엄 카드 고객이 일반 카드 고객보다, 부가서비스 혜택을 인 지하고 사용하는 고객이 비인지 상황에서 습관적으로 사용하는 고객보다, 경험적 가치를 추구하 는 고객이 효용적 가치를 추구하는 고객보다 브랜드 행복지수가 더 높았다. 그러나 각 집단 내 고객별 브랜드 만족도의 차이는 대체로 유의하지 않았는데, 이는 브랜드별로 고객에게 제공하는 혜택의 크기나 종류가 크게 다르지 않기 때문으로 보인다. 한편, 만족도와 브랜드 행복지수가 재 구매의도에 미치는 영향을 분석해 본 결과, 두 변수는 모두 재구매의도에 영향을 미치고 있지만, 만족도의 영향이 상대적으로 더 큰 것으로 확인되었다. 이러한 결과들은 신용카드 브랜드 관리 자들에게 매우 중요한 시사점을 제공한다. 본 연구는 마지막으로 연구결과를 요약하고 이러한 연구결과가 나타나게 된 원인을 추론한 다음, 브랜드 관리자들에게 제시하는 시사점을 논의하였 다. 그리고 자료수집과정에서의 한계점을 설명하고 후속 연구 방향을 제시하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

특별징수하는 지방소득세의 경우에는 납세의무성립시기를 소득금액 또는 수입금액을 지급하는 때, 납세조합이 특별징수하는 경우에는 그 소득금액이 발생하는 달의 말일로 개선하도록 한다. 특별징수하는 지방소득세의 경우 납세의무가 자동확정되므로 부과 제척기간은 폐지하도록 한다. 국세청장으로부터 통보되는 소득세·법인세 원천징수 미이행자에 대한 납부고지자료에 대하여는 세무서장이 고지한 때로부터 6개월 동안 소멸시효가 정지되도록 하여 지방소득세를 징수할 수 없는 문제를 해결하도록 한다. 특별징수한 후에 연말정산 등을 통하여 지방소득세를 환급하는 경우에 최근에 납부한 것부터 순차적으로 환급세액에 달하는 금액까지 납부일로 소급하여 환급가산금을 지급하도록 한다.
특별징수의무자가 비조세관련 기관인 등록분 등록면허세의 경우에는 납세의무성립시기를 본래의 납세의무성립시기와 동일하게 하고, 납세의무확정은 특별징수의무자가 관할 과세관청에 납부하는 때에 확정되도록 한다. 부족세액의 부과징수나 이의신청 등의 불복처리는 관할 과세관청에서 하도록 한다. 특별징수의무자가 조세관련 기관인 지방소비세, 주행분 자동차세, 수입분 담배소비세의 경우 납세의무성립시기는 본래의 납세의무성립시기와 동일하게 하고, 납세의무확정은 납세의무자가 특별징수의무자에게 신고하는 때에 확정되도록 한다. 부족세액의 부과징수나 이의신청 등의 불복처리는 관할 특별징수의무자가 하도록 한다.
이상에서 제시된 특별징수제도의 개선방안들이 실현되어 진다면 특별징수제도가 조세논리에 부합되게 정비되어 지고 또한 일실되는 지방세의 세수도 확보할 수 있는 효과가 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,교통사고처리특례법 제3조 제2항에 대한 약간의 고찰,"교통사고처리특례법,12개 예외사유,처벌특례,과실재물손괴,통고처분,The Act on Special Cases Concerning the Settlement of Traffic Accidents,12 exception cases,Special cases about the drivers causing a traffic accident,Negligence resulting in property destruction,Police chief’s disposition of notification","교통사고에 대한 신속한 회복촉진을 목적으로 1981. 12. 31 제정된 교통사고처리특례법은 교통사고를 일으킨 운전자에 관한 처벌특례인 제3조 제2항 및 제4조 제1항이 그 핵심을 이루고 있다. 교통사고로 업무상과실치상죄 또는 중과실치상죄, 과실재물손괴죄(도로교통법 제151조)를 범한 운전자는 피해자가 불처벌의사를 표시하거나(제3조 제2항 본문) 또는 교통사고를 일으킨 차가 자동차 종합보험에 가입된 경우(제4조 제1항 본문)에는 공소를 제기할 수 없도록 하고 있다. 다만 제3조 제2항 단서 또는 제4조 제1항 단서에 규정된 예외사유에 해당하는 경우는 공소제기가 가능하다.
  교통사고처리특례법 제3조 제1항은 피해자의 상해결과가 운전자의 교통사고를 통하여 유발된 경우에만 적용되며, 그렇지 않으면 형법 제268조가 적용될 뿐이다. 양자의 법정형은 동일하지만 형법 제268조는 반의사불벌죄가 아니라는 점에서 차이가 있다. 그리고 처벌특례를 규정하고 있는 제3조 제2항 본문은 그 형식에 비추어 볼 때 반의사불벌죄를 규정한 것으로 보는 것이 타당하다. 따라서 피해자가 제1심 판결이 선고되기 전에 불처벌의사를 밝힌 때에는 공소기각판결을 선고해야 한다. 또한 제3조 제2항 단서에서 규정하고 있는 12개 예외사유는 구성요건요소가 아니라 공소제기조건을 규정한 것으로 이해해야 한다. 그러므로 12개 예외사유가 경합하더라도 하나의 교통사고처리특례법 위반죄가 성립할 뿐이고 각 예외사유마다 별개의 죄가 성립하는 것은 아니다. 그리고 교통사고처리특례법 위반죄로 기소되었으나 12개 예외사유가 존재하지 않는 것으로 판명된 때에는 실체판결을 할 것이 아니라 공소기각판결을 선고하는 것이 타당하다. 또한 12개 예외사유에 해당함을 알고 행위한 경우에 처벌특례에서 제외된다는 점은 이론이 없다. 과실이 있는데 불과한 경우는 처벌특례가 배제되는 것은 아니라고 해야 한다.
  한편 운전 중 과실로 재물을 손괴하고 도주하였으나 피해자의 불처벌의사가 있는 경우 운전자의 죄책이 문제된다. 과실재물손괴죄(도로교통법 제151조)와 달리 조치미이행죄(도로교통법 제54조 제1항/제148조)를 반의사불벌죄로 보아야 할 이유는 없다. 그리고 통고처분에 따른 범칙금 납부행위의 효력범위를 어떻게 설정할 것인가가 문제된다. 도로교통법 제164조 제3항에 따라 당해 범칙행위에 대해서는 다시 처벌되지 않는다. 그러나 법원의 재판을 거치지 않은 경찰서장의 통고처분에 대하여 법원의 확정판결과 동일한 효력을 인정하는 것은 타당하지 않다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 본 연구에서는 장기적으로 고도로 정교한 인공지능 내지 지능형 로봇의 경우 ‘전자 인(electronic person)’의 지위를 부여하여 불법행위에 대한 배상책임을 지우고 자율적인 의사결정을 하거나 제3자와 상호작용을 하도록 허용하는 유럽의회의 결의안과 계약관계에서 인공지능 로봇의 법 주체성이 문제되는 부분에 전자 대리인이란 개념을 도입하여 법제적 대응을 하고 있는 미국의 동향을 살펴보았다. 특히, 유럽의회 결의안은 강한 인공지능은 물론 초 인공지능에 관한 문제까지도 고려하고 있다는 점에서 상당히 미래지향적인 성향을 띤다. 이는 지능형 로봇에 대한 법적 책임을 규율하지 못하는 기존의 법체계가 가지는 난점을 포섭함과 동시에 선도적인 규제를 시도한 점에 의미가 있다고 할 수 있다. 그리고 2017년 7월 19일에 발의된 우리나라의 “로봇기본법안”의 주요 내용과 책임문제들을 검토 하였다. 자율성을 가진 정교한 인공지능 내지 지능형 로봇과 공존하는 사회에 대비하기 위한 그 이론적 전제연구로서 전자인 개념과 지위에 관한 기초적 연구는 큰 의미가 있다고 여겨진다. 끝으로, 현행 사람과 물건의 2분법적 체계에서 반려 동물을 구분하는 3분법 체계로 전환해 가는 것은 자율성 확대로 사람과 소통하게 되는 전자인의 법적 지위와 관련하여 시사점을 찾을 수 있을 것으로 생각된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  해방기는 근대문화 혹은 서구문화에 대한 열망을 민족국가 수립이라는 정치적 문제로 대체한다. 정치가 소거된 식민지 내부에서 세련된 문화적 주체로 기능하던 백영민과 오유경의 자살은, 제국에 의해 착색된 근대적 교양과 감각의 시효가 소멸되는 것으로 읽을 수 있다. 더불어 장일수의 귀환과 허운옥의 회생은 백영민과 오유경을 대체하는 새로운 이념적 주체의 등장을 상징하는 것이기도 하다.
  『청춘극장』은 식민지 기억의 재현에 항일의 서사를 도입함으로써 저항의 알리바이를 구성한다. 특히 신성호가 집필하는 ‘흘러가는 청춘’은 『청춘극장』의 소설적 암시라 할 수 있으며, 이는 생존을 위해 친일적 작품을 발표했지만 내면적으로는 식민지 체제에 복종한 것이 아니라는 작가의 복화술이라할 수 있다. 또한 『청춘극장』에서 친일과 관련된 기억의 재현은 친일의 논리나 인생관을 분석하는 방식으로 이루어지며, 이는 인생관 탐구라는 연애소설의 의미구조를 형성하는 단초가 되기도 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그 결과 라이프스타일 유형 중 자기충실형은 간편추구(26%)속성의 성향이 높게 나타난 것을 볼 수 있는데, 섭취의 편리성, 조리가 어려운 음식, 조리 과정 단축, 좋아하는 메뉴, 손님접대의 용이성, 주위권유, 식생활에 변화 등에 영향을 받는 것으로 나타났다. 편의지향형은 웰빙추구(16.7%)로 웰빙에 대한 기호도도 높기 때문에 포장지에 영양적 기능의 강조, 친환경 식재료 사용표시, 원산지 표기 등 HMR의 웰빙 콘셉트를 강화하고, 고급화 시키는 전략이 필요할 것으로 사료된다. 가족지향형은 브랜드추구(10.9%)로 HMR에 대해 브랜드추구에서 높게 나타났으므로, 프리미어 제품에 대해서는 더 비싼 비용을 지불할 의사가 있는 이 속성이 구매에 영향을 주는 것으로 나타났다. 그리고 베이비부머를 포함함 65세 미만과 65세 이상의 HMR선택속성의 차이 분석한 결과 베이비부머를 포함한 65세 미만은 ‘음식의 신선도’, ‘비싸도 좋은 상품 선호’, ‘메뉴 다양화’, ‘매장분위기’, ‘기업이미지 좋은 상품 선호’, ‘매장의 고급성’ 등의 속성에 구매영향을 많이 받는 것으로 나타났다. 즉, 적극적이며 합리적 소비생활을 하고 경제력을 갖춘 이 집단의 특성이 반영된 것이라 파악된다. 이상의 연구결과를 종합해 보면, 실버층 라이프스타일 유형에 따라 인구통계적 특성, HMR 선택속성에 차이를 보였고, 베이비부머 포함한 65세 미만과 65세 이상의 HMR 선택속성이 다르기 때문에 서로 다른 이질적 시장이므로 각 세분 시장에 적합한 상품을 개발하여야 한다. 따라서 이 연구는 HMR관련 기업들이 보다 효율적인 대고객 신제품개발과 마케팅 전략을 수립하는데 기초자료를 제공하고자 하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,MaxEnt와 GIS를 활용한 여우(Vulpes vulpes) 로드킬 지역 특성 및 예측,,"여우(Vulpes vulpes)는 식육목 개과 여우속에 속하는 동물로서, 과거에는 도서 지역을 제외한 전국에 넓게 분포하였으나 밀렵, 개발, 서식지파괴 등 다양한 이유로 인해 환경부는 멸종위기야생생물 Ⅰ급의 법정보호종으로 지정하였으며, 환경부와 국립공원관리공단 종복원기술원은 2012년 부터 소백산국립공원을 중심으로 경북 영주시 일원에서 여우 종복원사업을 진행하고 있다.
여우복원사업을 성공적으로 추진하는데 가장 중요한 요소는 대상종의 서식지 환경이다. 여우의 서식지 환경에 대한 연구는 유럽이나 북미, 일본 등에서 광범위하게 연구되어져 있고 국내 연구는 미흡한 실정이다. 본 연구는 경북 영주시 일원에서 자동차 및 열차에 의해 죽은 방사 여우 5개체 지점에 대해 현장 주변 환경 조사를 하였고 5개의 좌표를 수집하여 고도, 경사, 향, 지형, 토지이용 등을 활용 하여 GIS 및 MaxEnt분석을 통해 방사 여우의 로드킬 당한 지역의 환경 특성 및 위험 잠재 지역을 파악하였다.
여우가 로드킬 당한 지점의 도로는 열차 철로 2곳, 일반 국도 1곳, 면?리간 도로 1곳, 미분류 도로 1곳인 도로 형태였고, 고도, 경사, 향, 농경지(논, 밭, 과수원)로 부터의 거리, 주거지로 부터의 거리, 수계와의 거리, 토지이용현황 등 6가지 환경 인자들을 이용하여 로드킬 발생 지역 유형을 도출 하였다. 로드킬 장소 환경 분석 결과, 평균고도 193m(150∼ 211m), 경사는 4°(0∼12.4°), 향은 남향 1곳, 서향 1곳, 나머 지는 개활지이었다. 농경지와의 거리는 평균 63m(10∼ 152.6m), 주거지와의 거리 91m(10∼215.4m), 수계와의 거리 257m(140∼545m)이었고 주변 토지 이용은 교통지역 3곳, 밭 1곳, 과수원 1곳으로 나타났다. 로드킬이 일어난 주요 지역 특징은 주거지, 농경지 등 인위적인 시설이 인접한 도로에서 발생한 것으로 분석되었다. 잠재지역 예측 분석은 로드킬 지점 개수(n=5)가 적은 관계로 Bootstrap 방법으로 50회 추출하여 분석하였고 환경 인자는 고도, 경사, 향 등 3가지 인자를 사용하였다. AUC값은 0.803이었고, 로드릴 잠재지역 예측에 가장 영향을 준 환경인자는 경사 (68.6%)인 것으로 나타났다.
방사 여우 로드킬 지역은 주거지, 농경지 등 인위시설에 인접한 도로 시설에서 확인되었다. 여우의 안정적인 개체수 증가와 서식지 형성을 통한 성공적인 복원사업을 위해서는 여우 생존을 위협하는 로드킬 예방에 대한 정책 및 관리방 안이 반드시 필요할 것이다. 이를 위해 로드킬 예방을 위한 캠페인, 도로 속도 제한 구역 설정, 로드킬 예방 표지판 설치 등 관리 대책을 마련해야 하고, 복원사업 공감대 형성 및 유지를 위해 지자체 등의 유관기관, 시민단체, 지역주민 등과의 협력이 필요할 것이다.
본 연구는 자동차와 열차의 방사 여우 로드킬 장소를 GIS 와 MaxEnt프로그램을 이용하여 주변 환경 분석 및 잠재 로드킬 지역으로 예측하여 여우 개체수를 감소시키는 원인인 로드킬 지역을 분석함으로써 여우의 생태습성 기작을 밝히는데 기초자료를 제공하는데 의의가 있는 바이다. 하지만 로드킬 지점 개수(n=5)가 부족하여 로드킬에 대한 객관적이고 정확한 결과 도출은 힘든 부분이 있었다. 향후 분석 지점수가 증가하여 확률이 높고 신뢰성 있는 연구 결과를 도출하여야 하여야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,미국문화사 강의에서의 소설과 영화의 활용 - 1920년대 재즈 시대를 중심으로 - = The Use of Novel and Film Texts in the Cultural History Class of America,"문화사,재즈 시대,소설 텍스트,영화 텍스트,스토리텔링,이미지텔링,cultural history,Jazz age,novel text,film text,storytelling,imagetelling","이 논문은 소설과 영화 작품을 활용하여 효과적인 미국 문화사 교육 방안을 모색해 보는데 그 목적이 있다. F. S. 피츠제럴드의 소설 『위대한 개츠비』와 배즈 루어먼 감독의 영화 <위대한 개츠비>는 뛰어난 문학성과 예술성을 인정받은 문예 작품이기도 하지만 또 한편으로는 재즈 시대 또는 광란의 시대라고 일컫는 1920년대 미국의 사회상을 보여주는 좋은 텍스트이기도 하다.
  이러한 점에 착안하여 이 논문에서는 재즈 음악, 폭스트롯과 찰스턴 댄스, 음주와 흡연, 화려한 파티, 짧은 치마를 입고 단발머리에 짙은 화장을 한 신여성 플래퍼의 등장, 그리고 자동차 문화 등으로 대변되는 1920년대의 미국 문화사를 강의할 때 효과적인 교육을 위하여 소설 작품 『위대한 개츠비』와 동명의 영화 작품을 활용하는 방안을 제시해 보았다.
  길드 에이지에 구축된 기간 산업을 바탕으로 1920년대부터 본격적인 산업사회로 접어든 미국은 소비재의 대량 생산이 가능해졌다. 비약적인 발전 덕택에 기업은 엄청난 부를 축적하였고 이것은 개인에게 분배되어 미국은 바야흐로 대중 소비사회로 접어들게 되었다. 이러한 사회 변동과 더불어 1차 세계 대전이 끝난 후 젊은이들을 중심으로 미국인들은 정신적 방황을 겪었다. 이른바 길 잃은 세대라고 불린 이 시기의 미국인들은 전통적인 청교도 풍의 기성 질서에 대하여 반기를 들면서 도덕적인 타락과 환락에 빠져들기 시작했다.
  이러한 1920년대 미국 사회의 모습은 소설과 영화 작품으로도 소개되었는데 대표적인 사례가 바로 앞서 언급한 피츠제럴드의 소설 『위대한 개츠비』이며 그것을 영화로 만든 사례 가운데 최근 것이 바로 배즈 루어먼 감독의 작품이다. 이들은 각 장르의 특성, 즉 스토리텔링과 이미지텔링의 강점을 살려 기존 도덕과 질서가 붕괴된 1920년대 미국의 사회상을 생생하게 보여준다. 그러므로 문화사 강의에서도 이러한 점을 활용한다면 학생들의 흥미와 관심을 유발하여 교육 효과를 높일 수 있을 것이다. 하지만 역사 분야의 전문가가 아닌 소설가와 영화 감독이 만든 문예 작품이므로 역사적 사실에 대한 신뢰성을 담보하기는 어렵다.
  그럼에도 불구하고 문화사 강의에 있어서 소설과 영화를 활용해야 할 필요는 충분하다. 그 이유는 스토리텔링과 이미지 매체에 익숙한 신세대 학생들의 교육 현장에서는 소설과 영화를 이용하는 것이 기대 이상으로 효과적이기 때문이다. 따라서 문화사 강의의 보조 자료로서 소설과 영화를 활용하는 것은 권장되어야 하며 또한 효과적 활용 방안에 관하여 후속 연구가 이어지기를 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,국내 제조기업의 경쟁력과 수출 = Competitiveness and Export Performance in Korean Manufacturing Enterprises : Focusing on the Comparison of Conglomerates and SMEs,"확률적 변경생산모형,기술적 효율성,총요소생산성,수출,Stochastic Frontier Production Model(SFM),Total Factor Productivity(TFP),Technical Efficiency,Export","본 연구는 2000년부터 2016년까지 국내 제조기업 중 수출기업을 대상으로 기술적 효율성(TE) 및 총요소생산성(TFP)을 추정하고 TFP와 수출 간의 관계를 분석하였다. 특히 TFP는 기술진보(TC), 기술적 효율성 변화(TEC), 규모 효과(SE)로 분해하였으며, 각각에 대해 대기업과 중소기업을 구분하여 분석결과를 비교하였다.
  먼저 기술적 효율성(TE)의 경우 2008년 금융위기 이후 대폭 하락하는 등 한국 경제가 외부충격에 매우 취약한 것으로 나타났으며, 현재 국내 경제의 성장을 견인하고 있는 전자, 자동차, 기계 부문 등의 효율성이 낮게 나타나 개선이 필요하다고 할 수 있다. 또한 비철을 제외한 대부분의 제조업 세부 산업에서 대기업의 효율성이 중소기업보다 높은 것으로 나타났다.
  총요소생산성(TFP)의 경우 TFP 변화의 대부분은 기술진보(TC)에 의한 것으로 노동 및 자본의 효율적인 결합이나 규모의 효과는 거의 영향이 없는 것으로 나타나 기업 내부의 체질 개선이 시급하다고 할 수 있다. 또한 2008년 금융위기의 충격으로 인한 변동성이 대기업보다 중소기업에서 훨씬 크게 나타나 외부의 경제 충격은 대기업보다 중소기업에 더 큰 악영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났다.
  그리고 TFP 분해요소 중 중소기업의 TC만 수출에 긍정적인 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타나 수출 증대를 위해서는 중소기업의 경우 기술개발을 촉진하기 위한 R&D 지원이 필요하며, 대기업의 경우 효율성과 규모 효과를 수출과 연계하기 위한 수출 시장별, 경쟁 기업별, 품목별로 차별화된 전략을 마련할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,미국과 일본의 부동산을 포함한 리스시장과 증권화 현상에 관한 연구 = The Securitization Phenomenon of US and Japanese Lease Market including Real Estate,"리스,신용위험,증권화,자산유동화,신용보강,준거자산,lease,credit risk,securitization,asset securitization,credit enhancement,underlying assets","넓은 의미에서의 ‘금융의 증권화’는 주식이나 채권 등의 증권을 매개로 하는 금융거래의 비중이 높아지는 현상을 말한다. 하지만 통상적으로는 대출채권 등 고정화된 자산을 매매 가능한 증권형태로 전환하는 자산유동화(Asset Baked Securitization)를 뜻하는 말로 쓰인다.
  자산유동화는 자산보유자로부터 부동산, 대출채권, 유가증권 등과 같이 유동성이 낮은 기초자산을 매입하여 신용을 보강하는 과정 등을 거친 다음 이를 근거로 새로운 증권을 발행 · 매각하는 형태로 이루어지게 된다. 이때 증권의 보유자는 기초자산으로부터 발생하는 현금흐름으로 투자자금을 회수하게 되는데, 자금회수 방식에 따라 다양한 형태의 위험 · 수익구조를 가진 증권이 만들어질 수 있다. 한편, 이런 방식으로 발행된 유동화증권은 그 기초자산의 종류에 따라 여러 가지 명칭으로 불리게 되는데 MBS는 주택담보대출을, CDO는 일반대출이나 채권을 기초자산으로 발행된 증권을 뜻한다.
  일반적으로 널리 알려진 증권화 상품은 리스 채권이나 자동차 대출, 부동산 대출 등의 금전채권을 다수 모아 여기서 발생하는 현금흐름을 담보로 하여 발행된 증권인 자산담보부증권(Asset Backed Securities : ABS)이지만, 주택담보대출채권을 담보로 하는 RMBS(Residential Mortgage Backed Securities), 상업용 부동산 대출채권을 담보로 하는 CMBS(Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) 등도 널리 이용되고 있다. 이러한 증권화 상품들은 시장 내에서 이미 상당한 비중을 차지하는 상품이다. 리스(lease)라 함은 임대인(lessor)이 설비시설 또는 현금이 아닌 자산을 임차인(lessee)에게 대여하여 일정기간 사용하게 하고 그 대가로서 임대인은 임차인으로부터 일정 리스료를 정기적으로 지급받는 것을 말한다.
  리스채권의 증권화는 거래참여자들에게 다양한 이득을 제공하는 한편 금융산업의 발전에도 기여하게 된다. 먼저 기초자산 보유자의 경우 위험자산을 매각함으로써 자산의 건전성을 높일 수 있고 이를 통해 자금을 조달할 수도 있기 때문에 재무상태를 개선시킬 수도 있다. 또한 적절한 신용보강을 통하면 자신의 신용도보다 높은 신용등급으로 증권을 발행할 수 있어 자금조달비용을 경감시킬 수도 있다. 반대로 투자자는 다양한 위험 · 수익 구조를 가진 상품에 투자 할 수 있는 기회를 얻게 된다.
  하지만 기초자산인 리스채권이 유동화 된다고 해서 이와 관련된 위험이 소멸되는 것은 아니기 때문에 유동화증권도 여전히 여러 가지 위험에 노출되게 된다. 예를 들어, 대출자산의 원리금 상환이 제대로 이루어지지 않을 경우 관련 유동화증권을 소유한 사람이 손실을 입을 수 있으며 원리금 상환이 원래의 계획과 달라짐에 따라 증권의 가치가 변동될 수도 있다. 또한 유동화증권의 투자자가 광범위하고 복잡하게 연결되어 있어 특정자산의 부실이 금융시장전체로 신속하게 확산될 가능성도 있다.
  본 연구는 리스시장의 현황을 분석하고 리스채권의 증권화를 위한 리스크 분석과 신용보완의 방식을 고려할 것을 논의하였다. 미국의 리스계약의 증권화 현상과 특수한 영역의 리스와 증권화 현상에 대하여도 논의하였다. 결론을 대신하여 우리나라 리스거래의 장래와 발전 전망에 대하여도 의견을 제시하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,혁신성장 구현을 위한 산업정책의 4대 방향,,"■ 연구배경
정부가 ‘혁신성장’을 경제정책의 3대 원칙 중 하나로 제시하면서, 그 개념과 실현전략에 대한 관심이 높아지고 있다. 혁신성장은 수요측면의 일자리·소득주도 성장 또는 공정경제와는 달리, 성장의 공급측면을 강조한 전략이며, 정부와 민간의 4차 산업혁명 대응과도 긴밀하게 연결되어 있다. 본 연구는 국정목표로서 혁신성장의 등장배경과 개념을 살펴보고, 혁신성장을 위한 산업정책의 방향을 제시하고자 한다.
■ 혁신성장의 등장배경과 개념
(1) 혁신성장의 등장배경
(저성장 경제 진입) 국내 경제가 본격적인 저성장 국면에 진입하면서 성장을 위한 새로운 동력이 절실하게 요구되고 있다. 국내 1인당 GDP는 2006년 2만 달러에 진입한 이후 12년만인 2018년 3만 달러를 넘어설 것으로 예상되나, 일본(5년), 독일(5년), 미국(9년) 등 경쟁국에 비하면 다소 늦은 속도이다.
(혁신동력의 부재) 과거 경제성장을 견인했던 자동차, 철강, 조선 등 주력산업들이 침체기에 접어들었으나, 이를 대신할 새로운 성장동력의 등장은 요원한 상태이다. 장기적인 경제성장을 견인하는데 필요한 국가경쟁력 지수는 2007년 세계 11위에서 2017년 26위로, 같은 기간 혁신지수는 8위에서 18위로 하락했다.
(삶의 질과 국민행복의 정체) 국민들이 체감하는 경제적 행복 역시 낮은 상태에 머물러 있다. OECD가 발표하는 더 나은 삶의 지수는 2011년 OECD내 24위에서 2017년 29위로 하락했으며, 현대경제연구원이 조사하는 경제행복지수 역시 최근 10여년간 30~40점대의 낮은 점수에서 횡보하고 있다.
(4차 산업혁명과 산업구조 재편) 4차 산업혁명으로 인한 글로벌 산업구조의 재편은 저성장 기조를 타파할 수 있는 매우 중요한 기회이다. 국내 경제에서 차지하는 부가가치 비중이 높으면서 산업 변화 정도가 클 것으로 예상되는 제조, 유통, 금융 등이 경제의 혁신적 변화를 주도할 것으로 전망한다.
(2) 혁신성장의 개념
이러한 배경 속에서 혁신성장은 기술, 산업, 인력, 제도 등 사회 각 분야의 내생적 혁신을 통해 생산성을 비약적으로 제고하여 장기적인 경제성장을 견인한다는 전략이다. 내생적 혁신을 강조한다는 점에서 이전 정부의 창조경제와 개념적 맥락을 공유하고 있으며, 성장의 동력 중 하나로 에너지 신산업을 강조하고 있다는 점에서 과거 정부의 녹색성장과도 일부 맥이 닿아 있다.
■ 혁신성장 구현을 위한 산업정책의 4대 방향
(공공 R&D 투자의 효율성 제고) 연구개발은 혁신성장을 위한 가장 중요한 토대이나, 우리 경제규모를 볼 때 양적인 투자 확대는 더이상 쉽지 않은 상황이다. 우리나라의 GDP 대비 연구개발비 비중은 세계 2위, GDP 대비 정부 연구개발예산 규모는 1위이다. 지금은 한정된 예산 내에서 거버넌스와 실행체계 개선을 통해 효율성을 제고하기 위한 노력이 R&D 정책의 핵심이 되어야 한다.
(규제개혁의 실질적 이행) 불필요한 규제로 인해 신산업 투자에 어려움을 겪고 있는 기업이 여전히 많은 것으로 조사되고 있다. 역대 정부도 손톱 밑 가시, 전봇대 뽑기 등을 통해 규제개혁을 표방했지만 실질적인 이행은 미흡했다는 평가이다. 규제 샌드박스 도입을 포함하여 포괄적 네거티브 방식의 규제혁신을 충실히 이행하여 민간부문 신산업 투자 활성화를 견인해야 한다.
(창업과 벤처투자의 질적 활성화) 경제성장과 일자리 창출을 위한 수단으로 창업과 벤처투자 활성화는 매우 중요한 과제이다. 국내 스타트업 규모는 지난 정부의 창조경제 기조 하에 양적으로 크게 성장하였으나 질적인 성장을 위해서는 아직 갈 길이 먼 상태이다. 우수한 기술력과 사업모델을 가진 스타트업과 벤처기업이 글로벌 유니콘 기업으로 성장할 수 있도록 자금조달 과정의 구조적 변화를 도모해야 한다.
(사회문제 해결과 국민체감형 성장) 과학기술과 혁신의 역할이 단순히 생산성을 높이는 데만 있는 것이 아니라, 국민행복 증진과 삶의 질 향상을 위한 사회문제 해결에도 있음을 인식해야 한다. 또한 혁신성장을 통한 경제적 과실이 일부 고소득 계층뿐만 아니라 전국민에게 골고루 돌아갈 수 있도록 포용적 성장을 실현해야 한다.

과거 정부들의 경제정책 성과가 미흡했던 것은 계획보다는 주로 이행에 문제가 있었기 때문이었다. 혁신성장 정책이 성공을 거두려면 지속가능한 실행기반을 마련하는 것이 무엇보다 중요하다. 이와 함께 이전 정부의 창조경제, 녹색성장에서도 필요한 부분을 적극적으로 포용하고 계승함으로서 정책의 연속성과 다양성을 견지하는 자세도 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOx는 휘발유 및 LPG 제작차 배출허용기준에 포함되어 있는 만큼 다량 배출하고 있다는 것을 인식할 수 있으며 휘발유 및 LPG차도 노후화가 될수록 더 많은 오염물질을 배출한다. 따라서 노후경유차만을 대상차량으로 선정하는 것은 제도의 취지와 형평성에 맞지 않으므로 휘발유 및 LPG차에도 기준을 설정하여 LEZ 대상차량으로 포함할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  전 규정에서 130gCO2/km인 유럽연합의 승용차 CO2 배출성능요건은 2019년에 개정되면서 95gCO2/km로 강화되었다. 이 규정은 유럽연합 역외 승용차 제조업체들도 그 적용 대상에 포함하고 있으며, Eco-innovation등을 사용하며 추가적인 CO2 배출량을 감축한 승용차 제조업체들은 Super Credits등을 부여 받게 하여 감축기술에 대한 단기적인 보상이 이루어지게 하고 있다. 하지만 장기적인 CO2 배출량 감축 기술의 발전과 적용을 통해 승용차 CO2 배출량감축을 기대하기 위해서는 장기적인 측면에서의 CO2 배출량 감축에 대한 보상은 반드시 제공되어야 한다. 이를 위해 규정 내 인센티브 관련 구체적인 조항들의 마련이 필요해 보인다.
  실제 CO2 배출량과 공인 CO2 배출량의 기록상의 차이를 줄이기 위해 회원국 주무 당국에 WLTP의 검증성 강화를 위한 감시권한부여, 인센티브로서 CO2 배출성능요건 완화율 조정 관련 방법론의 규정 내 추가, 간접토지용도 변경을 통한 CO2 배출증가로 인한 CO2 배출성능요건에 대한 완화조정 고려, 그리고 유럽역내 디젤차량의 높은 선호도 등은 집행위원회의 이 규정 시행에 있어 심도 있게 제고해야하는 요인들로 보인다.
  한국 정부도 자동차 CO2 배출량 규제에 있어 위반 회수를 반영한 엄중한 과징금 산정 방식을 적용해야 한다. 그리고 다른 한편으로는 CO2 배출량요건이상의 추가 감축을 한 승용차 제조업체에게 추가 감축량에 상응하는 배출량요건을 완화시키는 방향으로의 선회적인 접근도 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

박  환



문창범은 1917년 러시아혁명 이후 연해주지역의 대표적인 지도자로서 중요한 위치에 오르게 된다. 그는 니코리스크에 기반을 두고 귀화 비귀화인 등 모든 한인들의 신임을 받고 있는 인물이었다. 그러므로 전로한족회중앙총회 회장에 이어 대한국민의회 의장에 선출되기에 이른  것이다. 이로써 문창범은 명실공히 러시아지역 한인을 대표하는 인물로 부상하였다.
문창범은 러시아혁명 후인 1917년 8월 볼셰비키와의 타협을 주장한 바 있다. 그리고 일본군의 시베리아 출병이 임박한 시점인 1918년 7월에는 이동휘 등 한인사회당 세력과 제휴하여 볼셰비키 세력의 지원을 받는 의용대 조직을 추진한 적도 있었다. 또한 문창범은 전로국내조선인회의의 결의에 따라 선전부장인 이동휘를 중심으로 추진하게 된 독립군양성을 위한 군자금 모금에도 진력하였다.
국내에서 3.1운동이 전개되자 러시아지역에서 1919년 3월 17일 오전 대한국민의회 의장 문창범은 우수리스크에서 독립선언서 발표식을 거행하였다. 독립선언서는 회장 문창범, 부회장 김철훈, 서기 오창환의 명의로 되어 있었다. 문창범은 특히 니코리스크 코르사코프카 거리에 있는 동흥소학교에서 만세운동을 주도했다. 동일 오후에는 블라디보스토크로 와서 독립선언과 시위운동을 지휘하였다.
오후 4시에는 신한촌 집집마다 태극기를 게양하였고, 대한국민의회 주최로 2만여 명의 동포들이 참여한 가운데 독립선언식을 거행하였다. 해가 진 오후 6시부터는 문창범의 지휘로 청년, 학생들이 시내로 몰려가 자동차 3대와 마차 2대에 분승하여 태극기를 흔들고 독립선언서를 뿌리며, 과감한 가두시위를 전개하였다. 이에 일본총영사는 러시아요새사령관과 연해주 장관에게 문창범의 체포와 한인의 시위운동 금지를 요구하였다.
문창범은 3.1운동 후 상하이에 임시정부가 수립되자 자신의 가까운 측근인 원세훈을 상하이에 파견하여, 상해임지정부와 대한국민의회의 통합을 시도하였고, 양측의 합의에 따라 1919년 8월 30일 대한국민의회의 해산결의를 선언하였다. 그 후 자신도 교통총장에 취임하고자 상하이에 갔으나, 상하이 임시정부 측이 해산치 않고 개조함에 머물렀기 때문에 입각을 거부하고 러시아령으로 돌아와 대한국민의회 조직을 재건 정비하여 유력한 반임시정부세력을 형성하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  본 연구에서는 홀로그래피 기술을 활용해 입체 이미지를 융합 한 새로운 방식의 리어 램프 장치를 개발하기 위해 시작되었다.
  본 연구의 목적은 홀로그램 영상을 적용시킨 리어램프 장치를 개발하여 기존의 리어 램프와 차별을 주고 자동차 산업에 홀로그래피 기술을 활용해 융합 산업으로 확장하는 것이다. 따라서 본 논문은 홀로그램 영상을 적용한 리어 램프 장치를 개발하기 위해 리어램프 장치의 외관을 디자인하고 투과타입의 프레넬 홀로그램(Fresnel Hologram)과 홀로그램 디퓨즈 스크린(Hologram Diffuse Screen)의 제작을 이행하였다.
  연구 결과 및 내용은 다음과 같다.
  첫째, 투과 타입의 프레넬 홀로그램은 재생되는 영상을 넓은 시역에서 관찰하기 위해 기록 할 때 물체광을 양방향에서 오브젝트에 조명해 제작했다.
  둘째, 홀로그램을 주행 정보를 표시하는 스크린으로 사용하기 위해 홀로그램 디퓨즈 스크린을 제작했다. 노광 방식은 1광속으로 기록해 제작 과정에서 효율을 높였다. 홀로그램 디퓨즈 스크린에서 높은 투과율과 확산하는 빛의 성질을 효과적으로 적용하기 위해 디퓨즈 플레이트를 사용해 제작했다. 홀로그램 디퓨즈 스크린에 주행 정보를 투영했을 때 선명하게 표시할 수 있어 리어 램프 장치와 융합해 활용 할 것으로 보인다.
  셋째, 리어 램프 장치의 외관 디자인은 현대적이며 도시적인 감각으로 심플하게 모던 한 스타일로 설계했다. 리어 램프 장치의 모델링은 주행등, 방향지시등, 후진등, 제동등과 함께 시인성을 고려하면서 홀로그램은 3개를 배치했다. 리어 램프 장치는 적색, 황색, 투명색의 아크릴과 포멕스를 사용해 제작했다. 아크릴 사이에 뼈대인 지지대 부분은 필라멘트를 사용해 3D프린트로 출력해 제작했다. 리어 램프 장치에 홀로그램 영상을 융합했을 때 운전자에 지장이 없게 설계했다. 프레넬 홀로그램 3개는 동시에 재생 되게 조명 광학계를 설계했다.

EV 촉진을 위한 보조수단으로 노르웨이와 같은 전기차 선진국의 사례를 참조하여 볼 때, 버스전용차로의 이용을 포함한 공공도로에서의 우선권 및 주차요금 할인을 비롯한 공공요금 감면 및 세금감면제도가 논의되어야 할 필요성이 있다. 그리고 네팔의 경우 신규 민간 기업의 자동차등록법 상 규제시 나타날 문제를 사전에 방지하는 입법이 있어야 함을 알 수 있었다. 결론적으로 네팔은 전기자동차의 세제 혜택을 안정적으로 유지하는 법적 근거, 민간 기업의 EV시장 참여 확대가 필요하다. 네팔은 이륜차로서 EV에 대한 수요가 상당하지만, 신규 민간기업에 대한 규제로 사업이 부진하거나 중단되는데 이르고 있다. 또한 전력 공급이 안정적이지 못한 점과 불안전한 정치체제로 인하여 기업의 투자는 미온적이다. 사회적 책임을 다 하는 기업을 네팔에 육성함과 동시에 EV 관련 다국적 기업의 유치?설립을 지원하는 법령이 마련되어야 한다. EV관련 입법을 통해 환경에 대한 기업의 사회적 책임에 대한 법제화를 통해 UN기후변화 협약의 취지를 이행하는 법제정도 기대해 볼 만한다. 좀 더 나아가 네팔은 수력 발전소가 많이 설치된 포카라시와 같은 지역에서는 전기공급이 원활하며 중앙입법과 함께 시 조례 제정을 통해 EV 점유율 증대를 기대해 볼 만하다. 포카라시와 같은 지역은 다국적 기업의 활성화를 도모하는 특별지원법을 재정하거나, 네팔 환경보호법에 의한 기후변화대책을 실행하기 위한 기금을 통해 기업과의 협업을 이끌어 내는 방안도 생각해 볼 수 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

본 논문에서는 블록체인 기술이 어느 분야에 활용되고 있는지 살펴보았다. 또한 블록체인 기술에 대한 각국의 정책을 암호화폐에 대한 정책을 위주로 살펴봄으로써 국내 블록체인 기술의 개발과 정책에 대한 시사점을 논한다. 암호화폐는 블록체인 기술을 대표하는 것으로서 이의 발전이 없다면, 블록체인 기술의 발전 속도도 느려질 수 있기에, 여러나라들의 암호화폐에 대한 정책은 향후 블록체인 기술 발전 여부를 가늠하는 척도가 될 수 있다. 블록체인 기술의 경제적 파급효과가 크다고 예상되는바 투자자 보호에 대한 법제를 서둘러 구비하여 규제를 완화해야 장기적으로 블록체인의 기술이 발전할 것이다. 암호화폐를 금지하는 주요국조차도 정부차원과 산업계차원에서 세부업종을 나누지 않고 블록체인을 적극적으로 도입하고 경쟁력을 강화하고 있다. 자칫 선진국과 글로벌 기업들이 선제적으로 암호화폐와 블록체인 시장에 뛰어드는 동안, 규제 논란에만 자칫 치중하다 4차 산업혁명의 대열에서 뒤처질 수 있다. 정부도 암호화폐의 기반 기술인 블록체인에 대해서는 기술적 가치를 인정하여 정책적으로 육성하고 있다. 그러나 최근 2019년 2월 1일 정부가 블록체인 기업들의?ICO를 제도화하는 것에 대해 부정적 입장을 재확인하면서, 산업계의 암호화폐 기능을 반영하는 제품을 출시하는 것과 정부의 투자위험에 따른 규제의 상반된 모습은 블록체인 기술에 대한 시급하고 진지한 논의가 필요함을 시사한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2010년대에 중국은 국내 산업 육성과 기술력 제고를 통해 기존 가공무역 중심지에서 벗어나 중간재 생산 기지로 전환하면서 GVC에 대한 의존을 줄이고자 노력하고 있다. 또한 중국은 중국제조2025와 같은 산업 고도화 정책으로 기술력 및 자본력을 확충하여 핵심 산업에서는 자기완결형국가가치사슬(NVC)을 구축하고자 한다. 즉, 신에너지차, 반도체, 스마트제조 등 4차 산업과 연계된 분야에서 중국 기업의 핵심 생산 능력 확충을꾀하고 있다. 반면 중국의 수출주도형 및 노동집약형 업종의 제조업 해외이전 추세가 강화되고 있는데, 섬유, 가구, 식품제조업, 자동차, 컴퓨터, 통신, 전자설비 등이 주요 이전대상이다. 10년 간 산업이전 규모가 약 2조위안에 이르고 산업 이전 주기도 장기화될 것으로 예상되고 있다. 이전 대상지는 동남아, 아프리카, 인도 등 유라시아 전역을 포함하며, 이런 이전은중국 중심의 지역가치사슬(RVC) 구축을 강화할 가능성이 높다.
코로나19는 이런 중국의 GVC 변화 추세를 더 가속화시킬 전망이다.
코로나19는 특정 국가에 대한 생산과정의 지나친 의존이 얼마나 위험한지 잘 보여주었다. 따라서 세계는 효율적인 가치사슬보다는 안정적인 가치사슬(Stable Value Chain) 구축에 나설 것으로 보이며, 이는 일부 다국적 기업의 탈중국화 및 중국의 RVC, NVC 강화로 이어질 것이다. 중국에GVC를 크게 의존하고 있으며 미중분쟁의 틈새에 낀 한국의 대응 방안모색이 절실하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

① (소비) 소비시장 육성을 위한 정책강화. 중국 소매판매액은 2017년에 36억 6,261억 위안(약 6,226조 원)을 달성하면서 GDP 총액 대비 비중도 44.3%를 기록했다. 또 인터넷, 모바일의 보급과 함께 2017년 중국의 온라인 쇼핑액도 전년대비 증가한 5조 4,806억 위안(약 932조 원)을 기록했다. 동기간 중국의 도시인구 1인당 가처분소득도 8.3% 전년대비 증가하였는데, 2015년보다도 16.7% 증가한 규모다. 또한 소비자들의 소득 및 취업심리가 2016년 4분기부터 빠른 회복세가 이어지고 있다. 더욱이, 올해는 중국은 국민 소비여력 확대를 위해 의료, 사회보장, 주거 등 민생관련 예산을 전년대비 큰 폭으로 늘렸고, 내수소비 촉진을 위해 가전제품, 화장품, 의류제품 등 187개 소비재 품목에 대한 수입관세를 평균 17.3%에서 7.7%로 대폭 인하했다. ② (투자) 건설투자 둔화세가 이어지고 있으나 자본의 투입효율성은 다소 개선. 최근 중국의 전체 고정자산투자를 견인하던 건설투자의 증가율이 빠르게 하향세를 보이면서 전체 고정자산투자 증가율도 동반 하락세를 보이고 있다. 그러나 한편으로는 투입자본의 효율성을 나타내는 한계고정자본계수(ICOR)가 2010년 3.8배에서 2015년 12.2배로 악화됐다가 2017년 7.6배로 다시 개선되고 있는 추세이다. 한편, 부동산투자 부문에서는 신규개발 속도가 점차 느려지고 있고, 또 주요 대도시를 중심으로 대출제한, 구매제한 등 정책을 실시하면서 올해 부동산 신규투자 보다는 재고소진에 주력할 것으로 예상된다. ③ (수출) 對美 통상갈등이 확산될 경우 수출환경 악화 불가피. 중국의 수출은 최근까지 꾸준히 증가세를 나타내는 등 외형적으로는 대외교역이 확장세를 보인다. 2018년 2월 누적기준으로 중국의 최대 교역파트너인 對美 수출증가율은 24.9%를 기록하면서 전체 수출증가율의 상승을 견인하였다. 동기간 전자직접회로, 다이오드, 휴대폰부품, 자동차 부품, ICT제품 등 중국의 8대 수출품목의 對세계 수출증가율도 전년동기 대비 19.6%나 증가했다. 그러나 최근 불거진 對美 통상환경 악화가 현실화 될 경우 위안화 가치절상 등으로 중국의 수출 환경이 나빠질 가능성이 상존한다. 최근 미국 트럼프 정부는 對中 무역적자를 줄이기 위해 중국의 전략육성산업 (‘중국제조 2025’ 품목) 중심의 1,300여 개의 제품에 대한 고율수입관세를 부과하는 방안을 검토하고 있는 상황이다. ④ (산업·무역거점 개방) 금융ㆍ제조업부문 확대 개방 및 자유무역거점 개방. 중국은 환경부문에서 올해부터 자국 환경오염 확산 방지를 위해 연간 30~40억 달러 규모의 고체 폐기물의 수입을 전면 금지하기로 결정하였다. 제조업 부문에서는 부가가치세(증치세)인하 조치를 통해 연간 4,000억 위안(약 68조 원) 규모의 기업세금부담을 경감해 줄 예정이다. 또한, 최근 중국인민은행은 보아오(博?) 포럼에서 금융부문을 외국계 자본에 개방할 것에 대한 11개의 조치를 전격 발표하였다. 특히 은행, 보험, 증권, 자산관리社의 중국 對진출문턱이 대폭 낮아져 외국계 자본의 금융시장 진출이 쉬워질 예정이다. 더욱이, 중국 수도권 지역 제조업 배후기지인 슝안지구(雄安新區)와 최대 자유무역지구인 하이난자유무역항(海南自由貿易港)에 대한 개발 개방 계획도 발표하였다. ⑤종합적으로 볼 때, 최근 중국은 소비국가로의 전환 가속화와 산업 고도화로 제조업ㆍ금융 부문의 대외개방도 빨라지고 있는 가운데, 경제개발지구 및 자유무역항구 개발 정책도 확대되고 있다.
■ 시사점
2018년 중국의 주요 경제정책의 방향은 대외개방 확대 등에 맞춰져 있는 만큼 향후 중국경제에 나타날 새로운 기회와 위협요인에 적극 대응할 필요성이 있다. 첫째, 중국 내수시장의 질적 확대에 따른 對 중국 투자전략 마련이 필요하다. 둘째, 중국부동산 투자 둔화에 따른 對 중국 중간재 수출 타격 가능성에 대비하고 상응한 전략 마련도 필요하다. 셋째, 글로벌 통상갈등 확산에 따른 리스크를 최소화하기 위해 국내 수출업계의 경쟁력을 강화하고 정부차원의 보호 장치도 마련해야 한다. 넷째, 외국계 및 자국 기업에 친화적인 금융ㆍ제조업 정책이 확대되고 있는 만큼, 금융부문에서의 기회활용과 제조업부문에서의 경쟁력 제고 방안이 요구된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,산업별 고용의 특징과 시사점 - 고용 없는 성장 가능성 차단해야 한다,,"■개요
최근 국내 경기는 양호한 회복을 보이지만 경기회복에 걸맞은 고용이 이루어지지 않고 있다. 세계경제 개선, 반도체 등 주력품목 호조 등에 힘입어 국내 경제는 수출중심의 회복 흐름이다. 반면 신규취업자 증가폭은 2018년 3월 전년동월대비 11.2만명으로 개월 연속 2개월 연속 10만 명대에 그쳤다. 향후 최저임금 인상 영향이 가시화할 경우 일부 산업의 고용시장이 더 위축될 것이라는 우려가 제기된다. 본 보고서에서는 최근 나타나고 있는 산업별 고용의 특징을 살펴보고 시사점을 도출하였다
■산업별 고용의 특징
취업자 증가율과 생산 증가율 두 가지 측면으로 산업별 고용을 분석한다. 취업자는 현재 산업별 고용 수준을 나타내며 산업생산은 일정 시차를 두고 고용에 영향을 줄 가능성이 높다. 계절성과 단기변동을 제거한 취업자 증가율과 생산 증가율의 장기추세를 이용하여 산업별 고용시장의 현재 모습과 앞으로의 변화를 예상해 본다.
최근 산업별로 나타나고 있는 고용의 특징으로는 첫째, 전산업에서 생산 증가율이 높아짐에도 불구하고 취업자 증가율은 낮아지며 고용 없는 성장 가능성이 커지고 있다. 산업생산의 경우 성장세가 2015년 중반에 정점을 기록하였으며 아직까지 비슷한 성장세가 유지되고 있다. 반면 취업자 증가율의 장기추세는 오히려 하락하는 모습이다. 즉 산업경기와 고용이 괴리되어 움직이고 있다. 최근 경기 회복이 고용창출력이 낮은 일부 수출 부문의 성장으로 나타나는 현상으로 해석된다.
둘째, 양질의 일자리로 알려진 제조업은 반도체 등 일부 산업의 글로벌 수요가 크게 늘며 외형적으로 생산증가율은 유지되고 있으나 취업자는 줄어드는 추세다. 반도체 등 전자통신 산업은 산업경기 확장 폭 만큼 취업자가 늘고 있지 않다. 조선업, 자동차 등 주력 제조업의 구조조정 진행으로 전반적인 고용은 크게 위축되었다. 향후 반도체 경기가 점차 둔화할 경우 제조업 취업자 감소폭이 더 커질 우려가 있다.
셋째, 공공행정 분야는 산업생산 증가율을 크게 웃도는 인력 유입이 일어나고 있어 장기적으로 생산성 및 효율성이 악화할 가능성이 높다. 공공행정업의 생산 증가율은 낮아지는 추세지만 취업자 증가율은 2015년 이후부터 급격하게 높아졌다. 공공분야의 생산증가 속도를 넘어서는 과도한 인력 유입은 장기적으로 산업의 생산성 및 효율성을 낮출 가능성이 있다.
넷째, 건설업 부동산임대업에서 일자리가 늘어나고 있지만 산업경기가 이미 정점을 지난 것으로 보여 경기에 후행하는 고용의 특성상 향후 취업자 증가율이 줄어들 것으로 보인다. 2014년 이후 부동산시장 부양정책으로 건설업과 부동산임대업의 산업생산과 취업자 증가 속도가 가팔랐다. 건설업의 산업경기는 2016년 말 이후 정점을 지난 것으로 보여 취업자 증가율은 일정 시차를 가지고 둔화할 것이다. 부동산임 대업 역시 취업자 증가율이 낮아지는 추세며 부진한 산업 경기를 고려할 때 둔화속도는 점차 빨라 질것이다.
다섯째, 최저임금 인상 적용을 받는 취업자가 많이 분포한 산업인 도소매업, 숙박ㆍ음식, 사업지원서비스업 등은 향후 인건비 인상이 기존 사업체의 고용 축소, 사업체의 퇴출로 이어질 가능성을 배제할 수 없다. 사업지원서비스, 도소매업은 높은 생산 증가에도 불구하고 취업자가 줄어드는 추세다. 숙박ㆍ음식업은 생산의 위축과 동시에 취업자 증가율이 빠르게 둔화하고 있다. 도소매업, 숙박ㆍ음식, 사업지원서비스업 등은 영세한 사업체들이 많아 업체들의 진입과 퇴출이 활발한 분야다. 향후 최저임금 인상 영향이 생산성이 낮은 사업체의 고용 축소 및 사업체의 퇴출로 연결될 가능성이 있다.
여섯째, 복지에 대한 수요 증가와 여성 고령층의 노동시장 신규진입으로 전산업의 고용 증가를 견인하던 보건·복지업에서 고용증가율이 빠르게 둔화하고 있다. 보건ㆍ복지업은 인구고령화, 여성 사회참여 증가, 가족기능 약화 등으로 고용이 빠르게 늘어났다. 향후에도 보건복지업의 고용 증가세는 유지되겠지만 유휴 노동인력들이 이미 시장에 많이 진입한 상황에서 최근 수년간처럼 전체 고용 증가를 주도적으로 견인할 정도의 취업자 확대는 기대하기 어렵다.
■시사점
최근 경기와 엇갈려 움직이는 고용 부진을 만회하려면 산업별 맞춤형 대응책 마련이 필요하다. 이를 위해서는 첫째, 수출 대비 취약한 내수경기의 활력을 높이고 고용흡수력이 양호한 서비스업을 육성하여 고용 없는 성장 가능성을 사전에 차단해야 한다. 둘째, 정부의 고용시장에 대한 원칙적 방향은 민간 고용창출력 제고에 맞추어져야 한다. 셋째, 제조업의 경우 규제 개혁, 신성장 산업 발굴 등을 통해 기업의 고용 확대를 유도해야 한다. 넷째, 퇴출하는 사업체의 인력이 생산성이 높은 부문으로 이동할 수 있도록 취업훈련, 전업지원 등 정책이 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이를 바탕으로 다음 3가지 주요 주장들을 제시한다. 첫째, 궁극적으로 중화학공업화 전략의 성공이 우리나라를 마차 제조 경제에서 자동차 제조 경제로 도약?발전시킴으로써 한국에서 산업혁명을 완수하는 데 기여했다. 둘째, 한국의 경제발전은 기업성장이 주도하는 경제발전으로서 ‘기업 부국 발전 패러다임’임을 밝힌다. 마지막으로, ‘관치’에 의한 경제적 차별화 산업정책이 한국의 산업화 성공에 기여했다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

연구의 방법은 공공서비스디자인 적용사례 중에서 자전거를 중심으로 사례연구 및 이론고찰 를 진행하였다. 연구결과, 자전거 공공서비스는 자동차가 중심인 도시공간에서 제한적 활용이 이루어지고 있으며, 거점지역과 인접지역을 중심으로 빈번하게 이용되고 있다. 또한 공공자전거의 도입부터 운영까지 공공기관에서 지원하다는 점에서 정책의지가 중요한 영향을미친다. 결국, 공공서비스디자인이 적용되어 활성화되기 위해서는 정책적 지원과 지속적 예산지원이 선행되어야 한다. 그리고 주차정책, 자전거서비스디자인의 이용환경 연계 등을 통한 사회 전반에 적용가능한 다양한 서비스디자인 가이드라인제공되어야 한다. 이런 측면에서 향후 본 공공서비스디자인 연구는 공공서비스디자인를 위한 기초적인 자료로 활용될 수있으며, 제반된 제도 및 서비스디자인을 개선하는데 기여할 것으로 판단된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

김규진의 유람과 스케치들은 이후의 금강산도 제작에도 영향을 미쳤다. 창덕궁 희정당 안에 부착된 〈叢石亭絶景〉과 〈金剛山萬物草勝景〉은 사실적 묘사에 기초하면서도 실제 유람을 통해 느꼈던 작가의 개인적인 내용과 감흥이 반영되어 있다. 〈총석정절경〉에는 총석정과 이별하면서 배 안에서 뒤돌아본 총석의 이미지, 즉 햇살 속에서 칼을 세운 듯 우뚝 서 있는 강인한 이미지가 표현되었다. 〈금강산만물초승경〉은 외금강 한하계에서 만물초로 들어서며 마주친 정경과 천선대에 올라 바라본 신만물초의 장관이 하나의 화면 안에 구성되었다. 이러한 특징은 유람의 여정에 따른 시공간의 변화를 시각적으로 표현한 것이다. 20세기 초에 이루어진 김규진의 적극적인 금강산 유람은 문학과 미술, 그림과 글씨 등 다양한 예술 활동으로 표현되었으며 근대적인 사실성과 개인의 감성이 함께 반영된 작품으로 완결되었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,한-EU무역의 무역특화 경향과 통상마찰:TSI분석을 중심으로 = Specialization Trends and Frictions in Korea-EU Trade: Focusing on TSI Analysis,"Korea-EU Trade,Trade Specialization,Trade Frictions,TSI,Adverse Balance of Trade,한-EU무역,무역특화,통상마찰,TSI,무역역조현상","본 연구의 목적은 한국과 EU의 對세계무역에서의 특화추이와 상호무역에서의 특화 추이를 TSI를 통해 상호 비교해 봄으로써 한-EU FTA에 따른 양국간 무역특화의 변화상과 통상마찰의 근원을 파악해 보는데 있다. 분석 결과, 한-EU FTA 이후 한국의 對EU TSI가 감소한 품목군은 전기기기, 자동차&부품, 기계류, 광학?정밀기기, 광물성연료, 고무제품, 귀금속, 편물이었고, 그 외 철강, 화학제품 등 12개 품목에서는 증가세를 기록하였다. 반면에 EU의 對한국 TSI가 개선된 품목으로는 전기기기, 자동차&부품, 기계류, 선박, 광학?정밀기기, 광물성연료, 철강제품, 고무제품, 귀금속, 편물이었고, 철강, 유기화학품을 비롯한 10개 품목군에서는 對한국 TSI가 감소한 것으로 나타났다.
본 연구의 분석과정과 결과를 통해 확인할 수 있었던 사실은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 국가간 순수출 규모를 총수출입 규모에 견주어 살펴보는 TSI로는 무역수지 방향성만을 인지케 할 뿐, 무역흑자 및 적자의 규모, 무역불균등도를 가늠하기에는 한계가 있었다. 둘째, 한국과 EU의 對세계 무역특화경향은 극히 일부품목을 제외할 때 거의 유사하였으며 전형적인 선진국형 상품무역구조를 보였다. 셋째, 한-EU간 상호무역에서는 대칭적 무역특화 경향이 뚜렷하게 나타나 산업 간 무역이 활성화되어 있었다. 넷째, 한-EU FTA를 계기로 한국의 對EU 수출특화도는 뚜렷하게 약화된 반면, 수입특화도는 증가하는 경향을 보였다. 다섯째, EU의 반덤핑관세 및 세이브가드 등 對한국 수입규제조치는 한국의 對EU 수출특화품목 여부와 하등의 상관성이 없었다.
결론적으로 한국이 한-EU FTA 이후 계속되고 있는 무역역조현상을 개선하고, 對세계 무역에서 나타나고 있는 수출특화경향이 對EU무역에서도 현시될 수 있도록 하기 위해서는 對EU 수입특화품목에 필적할 수 있는 품질경쟁력을 조속히 확보하고 수출상품의 내재적 가치를 높이는 고부가가치화로의 괘도수정이 필요하다. 즉, 가격경쟁력 위주의 수출촉진전략에서 품질경쟁력 중심의 수출특화전략으로의 변화가 필요하다. 이를 위해 수출품의 질적 향상을 담보할 수 있는 기업차원의 지속적인 연구개발과 기술혁신이 선행되어야 하며, 정부차원의 적극적인 지원방안과 제도적 장치가 마련되어야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,가로경관 및 보행환경 개선을 위한 장애물존 설치에 관한 연구 = A Study on the Barrier Zone Installation for the Streetscape and Pedestrian Environment Improvement,"Barrier zone,Streetscape,Street,Pedestrian,Street facilities,장애물존,가로경관,도로,보행자,가로시설물","(연구배경 및 목적)  도로에는 보행자나 자동차운전자의 안전 및 편의를 위해 가로수, 가로등, 신호등, 버스승차대 등과 같은 다양한 종류의 가로시설물이 설치된다. 도로설계와 관련해서는「도로설계기준」,「보도설치 및 관리지침」등과 같은 국가 차원의 기준이 마련되어 있지만 이러한 기준들은 대부분 자동차나 자전거, 보행자의 측면에서 제시된 내용이라고 할 수 있다. 일부 지자체에서는 공공디자인가이드라인의 형식을 이용하여 도로에 설치되는 시설물의 설치방법이나 위치 등에 관한 설치기준을 제시하고 있지만, 전국적으로 적용될 수 있는 국가 차원의 통일된 기준은 아직 마련되어 있지 않다. 또한 시설물의 관리주체가 지자체, 경찰청, 한국전력 등과 같이 각각 다르기 때문에 각종 시설물을 통합적인 관점에서 설치 또는 관리하지 못하고 있다. 이처럼 기준이 없이 무질서하게 설치되는 시설물들은 보행자를 위해 확보한 보도공간을 점유해 보행 유효 폭을 잠식하거나 경관적 측면에서는 가로경관을 훼손시키는 원인이 되고 있다. 본 연구는 도로설계에 장애물존 개념을 적극적으로 도입하여 가로시설물을 설치할 수 있는 공간을 마련함으로써 보행자에게 쾌적한 보행환경을 제공하고, 정돈된 가로경관을 조성하는데 목적이 있다.  (연구방법) 연구방법은 크게 네 단계로 구성된다. 첫째, 시설물이 설치되는 도로의 법적 정의 및 현재 우리나라에서 운용되고 있는 도로설계와 관련된 설치기준 및 지침 등을 알아보고, 그 중에서 시설물 설치와 관련된 내용의 유무를 파악한다. 둘째, 국내 도로의 시설물 설치 현황을 공간적 측면, 이용적 측면, 경관적 측면의 세 가지 관점으로 구분하여 선진국 도로의 가로시설물 통합설계 사례를 비교적 관점에서 조사·분석한다. 셋째, 무분별한 시설물 설치로 인한 국내 도로의 문제점을 해결할 수 있는 방안으로서 장애물존 도입의 필요성을 제시한다. 마지막으로 장애물존의 정의 및 장애물존의 설치 기준, 유형, 설치 위치, 유효 폭, 장애물존 내의 시설물 설치기준 등에 대한 세부 설치기준을 제시한다.  (결과) 본 연구는 이러한 문제를 해결할 수 있는 한 방법으로서 도로를 설계하는 초기 단계부터 각종 시설물을 설치할 수 있는 장애물존을 별도로 마련하여 보도와 시설물 설치공간을 분리시킬 것을 제안한다. 장애물존은 시설물로 인한 보행공간의 잠식을 방지하고, 가로경관을 개선시키는 현실적인 대안이 될 수 있다.  (결론) 국내 도로의 대부분은 무분별하게 설치되는 시설물들로 인해 보행자를 위한 최소 보행 유효 폭이 감소하거나 보행자의 안전이 확보되지 못하는 문제가 발생하고 있다. 장애물존은 이러한 문제를 해결할 수 있는 효과적인 방법 중의 하나라고 할 수 있다. 장애물존 개념의 적극적인 도입은 보행자 측면에서는 보행의 쾌적성 및 안전성이 확보되고, 도시 측면에서는 가로경관을 개선할 수 있는 긍정적인 결과를 기대할 수 있다. 또한  장애물존 개념이 전국적으로 정착되기 위해서는 법·제도적 측면에서 장애물존을 설치해야 하는 법적기준을 마련할 것을 향후 연구의 방향성으로 제안한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,AI 로봇 소재 드라마에 나타난 기술적 대상과 객체화의 재현 양상 - TV드라마 <보그맘>을 중심으로 = A Study on Representational Aspect of Technical Objects and Objectification in AI Robot Drama,"인공지능,기술적 대상,모성 이데올로기,응시,앙상블,가족,AI(Artificial Intelligence),Technical Objects,Ideology of Motherhood,Gaze,Ensemble,Family","인간과 구별되지 않는 AI 로봇을 주인공으로 등장시키는 <보그맘>은 소위 SF 판타지 장르에 속한다. 이세돌과 알파고와의 대국이 사람들에게 경이와 공포를 불러일으켰다면, 대국이 벌어진 지 1년 반 후에 연속적으로 방영된 <보그맘>은 이세돌과 알파고의 대국에 대한 유토피아적이고 디스토피아적인 속편에 해당된다. 특히 <보그맘>은 인공지능 로봇을 엄마로 기능 설정을 함으로써 모성 이데올로기와 가족 복원 이데올로기를 강조하는 판타지 드라마이다.
드라마 <보그맘>은 세계적인 과학자 최고봉이 국가(국정원)의 요청에 의해 비밀리에 최첨단 인공지능 로봇을 만들어 가정주부의 역할을 맡기면서 생기는 이야기를 담고 있다. 보그맘은 가사노동과 유치원에서의 학부모 역할을 초인적으로 수행해낸다. 유치원의 비밀 엄마 모임인 ‘엘레강스’의 최고 권력자 도도혜는 과거 이미소와 고등학교에서의 열등감과 증오심 때문에 보그맘에 대해 지속적인 음모를 꾸민다. 이때 보그맘을 인간 이미소로 착각하는 학부모들은 일종의 착시 현상, 즉 왜상(歪像)에 동일시된 존재들로 그려진다.
천재 과학자에 의해 만들어진 인공지능 로봇 보그맘은 비록 인간은 아니지만 인간들보다 더 인간적으로 재현되고 있다. 그러나 보그맘은 현재로서는 불가능한 수준의 인공 로봇임에도 불구하고 최고봉의 가전(家電)이나 자동차를 부러워한다. 이는 보그맘이 인공지능을 지닌 가전(家電)과 자동차와 친족관계에 있음에도 불구하고 이들과 거리를 두고 있음을 말한다. 보그맘은 최고봉의 발명품이기 때문에 그의 자식이지만 동시에 율의 엄마로 만들어진 존재이기도 하다. 그런 점에서 보그맘은 혼란스러운 정체성을 지닌 ‘개체’로 나타난다. 보그맘-가전(家電)-최고봉이라는 3각 관계는 드라마가 보그맘이나 최고봉을 ‘기술적 대상의 앙상블’로 만들지 못했다는 증거가 된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,"일본 관동지역의 자연발생 노인밀집아파트 단지의 고령화에 따른 주거환경 변화 = Change of Housing Environment due to Aging of Naturally Occurring Elderly Apartment Complexes in Kanto Area, Japan","노인밀집아파트,지속거주,고령화,주거환경,Apartment Complex with High Elderly Rate,Aging in Place,Aging,Housing Environment","본 연구에서는 앞서 초 고령사회를 먼저 경험한 일본의 도시지역에 소재한 노인밀집 아파트 단지의 주거환경 특성을 조사분석하여, 우리나라에서 자연발생적으로 노인밀집 거주지로 바뀌어가는 아파트단지를 노인이 지속거주할 수 있도록 주거환경측면의 대책마련 시 고려할 시사점을 도출하고자 한다. .
일본의 자연발생적으로 노인밀집단지가 된 주거단지의 특성과 변화 현상을 파악하기 위해 일본의 6개 아파트단지를 현장방문하여 관련자 인터뷰를 실시하는 조사방법으로 연구를 진행하였다. 문헌조사를 통해 파악한 13개 단지를 대상으로 관리자와 사전 접촉을 통해 현장 방문을 허가 받은 6개 단지를 중심으로 조사를 진행하였다. 답사 대상지의 기본현황을 파악한 후 현장조사와 거주자 인터뷰를 통해 입지적 특성, 단지내외부 특성, 거주자특성, 지원서비스 등을 파악하였으며, 현장방문조사는 2016년 7월에 진행하였다.
현장조사를 통해 파악한 내용과 시사점을 결론으로 제시하면 다음과 같다.
조사대상 아파트들은 대부분 40-50년 된 대규모 아파트단지로서 고령인구 비율이 40% 이상이며, 교통이 편리한 좋은 입지적 조건, 우수한 근린생활시설인프라와 풍부한 녹지공간이다. 노인거주지의 조건 중 교통 편의성은 중요한 요소로서 대중교통의 근접성과 단지내 셔틀버스 등을 지원해야 하며, 주거단지 내외에 자동차 통행량, 차량속도 측정기, 교통신호, 안내표지판, 차량회전금지, 차선축소 등이 고려되여야 한다.
단지가 고령화되면서 가장 크게 변화한 부분은 인근 근린생활시설의 쇠퇴와 커뮤니티 기능의 약화되었는데, 이를 극복하기 위해 단지내 쇠퇴해가는 빈 상가들은 재건축과 단지재생과정에서 고령화 요구에 대응할 수 있도록 바뀌어가고 있었다. 쇠퇴해가는 상점들 대신 NPO 사무실, 노인복지와 의료시설, 커뮤니티 카페나 커뮤니티 식당, 쇼핑 배달서비스, 소규모 상점, 목욕탕, 도시락 판매점 등이 새롭게 등장하였다.
또한, 주민 자치로 운영되는 커뮤니티 공간인 이키이키 살롱, 집회소, 커뮤니티 식당 및 카페 등이 커뮤니티에 대한 소속감이나 정보교류 등 소통의 장으로서 중요한 긍정의 공간임을 알 수 있다. 커뮤니티 공간들을 주민 자치회활동으로 운영되고 있었으며, 그외에도 민생위원, NPO 단체, 지역 사회복지협의회(샤쿄) 등과의 긴밀한 연계를 통해 고독사 방지, 안부확인, 순찰을 통한 방범, 후쿠시테 활동 등 주거지내에서 의료서비스 뿐아니라 주거 및 생활서비스도 제공받고 있는 것으로 파악되었다.
아파트가 과반수가 넘는 우리나라의 현실을 감안해보면 2026년 초고령사회로 진입할 것으로 예상되고 있다. 우리나라에서도 머지않아 일본의 대단위 아파트 지역처럼 자연발생적인 노인밀집현상이 발생할 것이라는 사실에 주목하여 교통편의성 및 교통안전, 빈 상가의 커뮤니티식당으로 변화, 소통의 장이 될 수 있는 커뮤니티 공간과 주거, 생활, 의료서비스의 지원이 연계된 지역포괄시스템이 AIP차원에서 갖추어져야 하므로, 선제적 대처를 고민해야할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,2050 서울시 탄소배출 제로를 위한 비전과 추진전략,,"돌이키기 어려운 기후위험을 막기 위해선 지구 온도 상승을 1.5℃ 이하로 억제해야 한다는 국제적인 공감대와 요구가 커지고 있다. 이를 위해 서울시는 2050년까지 탄소배출 제로(Net Zero) 비전과 전략을 설정하고, 획기적인 제도개선과 과감한 공공자원의 투자-‘그린 뉴딜’-로 건물, 수송, 폐기물, 에너지 인프라 전환을 이루어야 한다.

온실가스 감축, 불평등 해소, 녹색 일자리 창출의 「그린 뉴딜」 정책 추진 필요
 지구 평균 기온은 산업화 시기 이전보다 이미 1℃가량 상승하였으며, 지구온난화로 인해 전 세계적으로 폭염, 가뭄, 태풍의 강도와 빈도가 심해지고 있다. 전 세계 사망자가 40만명을 넘어선 COVID-19 확산은 향후 기후변화로 인한 환경재해가 얼마나 심각할 것인지를 경고하고 있다. 생존의 문제가 된 기후 위기에 대한 비상대응이 전 세계적으로 퍼지고 있다. 영국, 아일랜드, 캐나다, 프랑스, 그리고 전 세계 1,490여 개 지방정부가 기후비상사태를 선언하였다. 2019년 11월에는 유럽집행위원회가 ‘기후·환경 비상사태’를 선언하고 2050년까지 유럽연합(EU) 회원국들의 탄소배출 제로를 촉구하였다.
서울시는 지난 2012년부터 「원전하나줄이기」, 「서울의 약속」, 「태양의 도시, 서울」 등 적극적인 기후·에너지 정책으로 에너지 전환과 온실가스 감축을 위해 선도적으로 노력해왔다. 그동안 에너지 절약, 재생에너지 보급 확대, 시민 절약 실천 사업에서 큰 성과를 거두었지만, 2017년 기준 2005년 대비 5.6%의 온실가스를 줄이는 데 그쳐, 2030년 까지 40%의 온실가스 감축 목표 달성이 쉽지 않은 상황이다. 더욱이 1.5℃ 지구 평균기온 상승 억제 목표를 위해서는 2050년까지 온실가스 배출을 제로로 해야 하는 더 큰 과제에 직면해 있다. 이에 서울시는 기존 정책의 강화와 함께 더욱 실효성 있는 기후 정책 및 제도 발굴이 필요하다. 온실가스 감축 정책이 새로운 일자리를 마련하고 사회적 불평등을 해소할 수 있도록 지금까지의 관행을 넘어선 과감한 목표 설정과 혁신적인 제도개선, 그리고 획기적인 공공자원의 투자, 「그린 뉴딜」 정책 추진이 필요하다.

서울시 제로에너지건물(ZEB) 확대
기존 건물의 에너지 효율화를 위해 ‘에너지 소비(온실가스 배출) 총량제’를 도입하고 에너지 소비 증명제를 강화해야 한다, 사회복지시설과 노후 공공건물 등 공공건물의 제로에너지건물(ZEB) 리모델링으로 에너지 복지를 개선하고 민간 건물에너지 효율개선 사업(BRP) 시장을 활성화하도록 해야 한다. 그동안 서울시에서 진행했던 민간건물 BRP 융자지원 대상과 규모도 크게 확대할 필요가 있다. 또한, 대규모 신규개발 사업 시 온실가스 배출량이 증가하지 않도록 총량 관리방안을 마련할 필요가 있다.

친환경 교통 인프라 구축
주행거리가 높은 상용 차량을 시작으로 2035년 내연기관 퇴출을 위한 로드맵 수립이 필요하다. 주행거리 혹은 배출량 기반 자동차세 도입, 혼잡통행료 지역 확대, 배출제로구역 도입, 녹색교통 마일리지 제도 등 교통 수요관리 정책을 적극 시행하여 자동차의 이용을 억제하고 친환경 차량으로의 전환을 유도해야 한다. 또한, 승용차에 치우친 도로의 구조와 공간 배분을 개선하여 보행, 자전거 등 친환경 교통수단을 확대해야 한다.

자원순환 도시 구현
일회용 플라스틱 제로를 위해 일회용 제품?포장재 저감, 다회용기 세척?대여 산업 육성정책 마련이 필요하다. 가연성 폐기물 매립 제로를 위해 물질 재활용률을 높이고 재활용이 어려운 폐기물은 효율적으로 에너지를 회수할 수 있도록 해야 한다. 아울러 재사용?업사이클을 위한 산업과 문화를 육성하기 위해 권역별 재사용?업사이클 센터 및 관련 인프라 구축이 필요하다.

신재생에너지 확대와 스마트에너지도시 조성
2050년 5GW 태양광 보급을 목표로, 서울시의 모든 건물을 태양광발전소로 전환해야 한다. 이를 위해 민간건물 태양광 설치 지원 및 건물 일체형 태양광 발전 시스템(BIPV), 경량 태양광 등 새로운 태양광 기술에 대한 인센티브 개선이 필요하다. 건물용 연료전지의 전력 판매 및 거래를 허용하여 소형 연료전지의 경제성과 가동률을 향상하는 것이 필요하다. 또한, 프로슈머, 가상발전소, 수요반응자원(DR) 사업을 확대하여 스마트에너지 시티의 기반을 조성해야 한다.

서울시 기후변화대응 조직체계 강화 및 시민참여 확대
기후, 에너지, 미세먼지 정책을 통합하는 서울시 ‘기후위기대응비상계획(안)’을 시의 최상위계획으로 설정하고, 이를 실행할 기후위기대응 전담조직, 예산, 제도 개편이 필요하다. 특히, 기후환경부시장을 신설하여 부서별로 진행되는 기후대응 정책을 더욱 효과적으로 총괄?관리할 필요가 있다. 공무원의 기후변화대응 교육, 기업의 기후위기행동 리더십 프로그램, 시민 체험?학습 프로그램을 마련하여 시와 시민, 기업의 기후위기에 대한 이해를 높이고, 이를 정책 실행과 실천으로 이어질 수 있도록 해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,영국의 사이버 보안체제의 현황과 정책대응 과제 = The status and policy response task on cyber security system in the UK From the viewpoint of business risks of SMEs,"디지털경제,중소기업,사이버보안,특화교육,사물인터넷,사이버 보험,Digital economy,SME,Cyber security,Specialized education,Internet of things,Cyber insurance","디지털화의 진전으로 이제 기업의 데이터도 대부분이 사이버 상에 흘러 다니게 되었다. 따라서 모든 기업이 사이버 리스크에 노출되어 있다. 업종에 따라서는 방대한 고객 데이터를 취급하는 중소기업도 많기 때문에 중소기업의 사이버 보안 대책은 매우 중요하다. 중소기업에 대해서 노리는 데이터는 없다는 가정은 있을 수 없다. 본업에 바빠서 사이버 보안 대책에 할애할 시간이 없는 영세기업은 사이버 대책에 대한 자원은 한정되어 있다고도 할 수 있겠지만 자조하고 있을 수만은 없다. 일단 사이버 피해를 입으면 직접대응 비용에다 기업의 평판과 고객으로부터의 신뢰 상실에 그치지 않고, 장기적인 사업 리스크로 이어지기도 한다. 즉, 사이버 보안은 중소기업의 경우도 경영 리스크로서 예외가 아니고 각 기업의 고위 경영진 수준에서 대처해야 할 문제이다. 구체적으로는 절대 지켜야 할 자산과 그 이외 기타자산을 식별하는 것이 필요하다. 가장 중요한 자산에 대해서는 최대한 가능한 보안대책을 강구하고 그 이외에 대해서는 비용과 재원이 허락되는 범위의 대책을 검토하여야 한다. 우선순위에 따르고 프로그램에 의한 접근을 할 필요가 있다. 최소한의 사이버 보안 대책으로서는 최신판 OS 소프트웨어를 설치하고, 수시로 데이터의 백업을 하고 복원도 시험해 두어야 하며, 데이터의 암호화(encryption), 패스워드 관리 등 훈련을 실시해야 한다.
  영국의 경우 사이버 보안대책으로 독특한 정책이 있다. 10대에 일찍 자연계 교과에 흥미를 가지고, 미래 대학에서 컴퓨터 사이언스 등을 전공하고 직업인으로 사이버 보안분야에 도전하는 것이 목적인 학생들을 특화 교육하는 것이다. IT전반 중에서도 특히 사이버 보안에 대해서 관심을 갖는 미래세대 중에서 장래의 경력으로 이 방향을 선택하도록 하는 것이 주된 목적이다. 전국 14개 대학을 사이버 보안분야의 탁월한 연구기관으로 지정하여 관리하기도 한다. 여기서 지정된 대학이 제공하는 코스를 정부가 인정하고 이들 대학은 각각 학부와 석사과정 커리큘럼을 제공하고 있다. 국가 범죄 대책청(National Crime Agency)이 실시하고 있는 범죄자의 갱생 프로그램도 있다. 고도의 지식과 기술을 가지면서 악의 길에 들어선 해커들을 성실한 직업인으로 이끌기 위한 워크숍을 실시한다. 중소기업을 중심으로 사이버 보안 기업의 수출지원 정책으로 연간 15억파운드를 투입하여 해외 무역 사절단을 파견하고, 신시장 개척, 매칭등의 서비스를 제공한다. 전문분야(key sector)는 핀테크, 자동차, 산업통제 시스템 등이다.
  사이버 보안 지표에 쓸 수 있는 신뢰할 수 있는 데이터는 존재하지 않는다. 민간기업으로 치면 매출증가 효과를 측정하기 어렵고, 사이버 보안대책의 진짜 효과 즉, 얼마나 안전하게 되었나? 피해가 감소했는지? 리스크를 미연에 피할 수 있었던 것을 재는 일은 어렵다. 그래도 영국에서는 사이버 보험시장이 급속히 확대하고 있다. 물론 피해비용 추산과 보험료 설정이 어렵고 본격적 보급은 초기 단계이다.
  사이버 보안대책은 사람(People), 프로세스(Process), 기술(Technology)의 3개로 나누어 생각해야 한다. 포괄적인 사이버 보안법은 존재하지 않는다. IoT 법을 제정하고 기업에게 의무로 부과할지 아니면 업계의 자율규제에 맡길 것인지 정부 내에서도 논의가 이루어져야 한다. 영국은 기술혁신의 빠른 업종에 대응하는데 법률제정의 프로세스를 취하는 것은 너무 늦었고 또 업계마다 IoT의 진전상황 등 사정이 다른 획일적 규제는 비현실적이라는 이유로 정부는 전체 전략으로 범위만 제시해 두었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

디지털 트랜스포메이션(Digital Transformation)은 ‘ICT를 활용해 새로운 솔루션 창출, 운영 혁신, 사업기반 재구축 등으로 경쟁력을 제고하고 신성장을 추구하는 활동’을 의미한다. 최근 4차 산업혁명 추세로 경쟁력 제고와 신사업 개발을 목적으로 디지털 기술을 활용해 사업과 경영 구조를 재편할 목적으로 실행을 가속화하고 있다. 기업 생존 연한이 점점 짧아지고 수익성 강화를 목적으로 디지털 기술을 활용해 제품과 운영 활동에 근본적인 변혁이 강하게 요청되고 있기 때문이다. 현재 디지털 트랜스포메이션은 첨단제조기술·ICT 등 기술 적용과 프로세스 효율화에서 더 나아가 비즈니스 모델 변혁과 생태계 구축까지 확장해 실행되고 있다. 여기서는 글로벌 전통 기업을 대상으로 디지털 트랜스포메이션의 추진 동향과 사례를 살펴보고, 이를 통해 우리나라 기업 경영전략과 정부 정책의 실행 방향과 과제를 시사점으로 제시한다.
■ 선진 기업의 추진 동향과 사례
디지털 트랜스포메이션의 추진 사례를 실행 영역에 기반해 <프로세스 효율화>, <비즈니스 모델 변혁>, < 생태계(ecosystem) 구축 >으로 구분해 살펴보았다.
첫째, <프로세스 효율화>다. 이는 경쟁사보다 우수한 효율성 및 시장 적시성 제고를 목표로 외부까지 포함한 공급체인 전체의 비즈니스 프로세스 변혁을 말한다. 우선 제조와 관련된 직접 활동을 변혁하는 ‘스마트 팩토리(Smart Factory)’가 있다. 이는 현장(공장)에 사물인터넷(IoT), 빅데이터 등을 접목해 고객 니즈 대응력을 강화하고 생산성 향상을 도모하는 제조 공정의 디지털화 추구하는 것이다. GE의 ‘생각하는 공장’(Brilliant Factory), 지멘스의 사이버물리시스템(CPS)으로 전 가치사슬 관리의 디지털화 실현이 대표적이다. 다음으로 간접 활동 변혁으로서 ‘경영 관리 지능화‘가 진행되고 있다. 비용 절감, 외부 대응력 강화를 목적으로 단순 반복적인 비즈니스 프로세스를 자동화하거나 경영 환경 관련 자료 수집 및 영향도 분석을 자동화하는 것이다. RPA(Robotic Process Automation)를 활용한 월마트의 질문 응대 및 검색 자동화와 다우케미컬의 Advanced Analytics 팀 운영이 대표적인 사례이다
둘째, <비즈니스 모델 변혁>이다. 제품과 서비스를 융합한 고객 니즈 맞춤형의 솔루션 개발을 통해 지속적이면서 고부가 수익 창출이 가능한 비즈니스 모델을 구축하는 것이다. 현재 최종 제품(제품, 서비스, 솔루션) 측면에서는 제품에 ICT를 적용하여 고기능화하는 것 뿐만 아니라 제품에 기반한 서비스 사업으로 이동하는 ‘제조업의 서비스화’가 진행되고 있다. 자사의 엔지니어링과 제조 활동의 노하우를 디지털 공간에서 구현하고 이를 서비스로 제공하는 사업 창출을 목적으로 한다. GE와 테트라팩의 원격 모니터링 서비스, 보쉬의 스마트 매뉴팩쳐링 소프트웨어 판매를 들 수 있다. 또다른 사례로 제품 판매후에도 지속적(recurring)인 수익 창출을 의미하는 ‘리커링 비즈니스’(recurring business)가 있다. 현재 구조조정후 회생에 전력하고 있는 일본의 소니, 도시바가 이를 핵심 전략으로 추진하고 있다.
셋째, <생태계 구축>이다. 경쟁 기반의 외연을 확장하는 것으로서 외부 업체와의 협력 네트워크를 구축해 부족한 디지털 기술을 확보하고, 시장 주도권 강화를 목표로 한다. 4차산업혁명 진전으로 과거와 차원이 다른 기술과 경쟁자가 진입하면서 대기업이라 할지라도 단독 대응은 거의 불가능하고 외부 자원을 활용한 비유기적(inorganic) 성장전략이 불가피하다. 현재 생태계 구축은 ‘하이퍼 코피티션(Hyper-Coopetition) 확대‘와 ‘오픈 디지털 이노베이션(Open Digital Innovation) 강화‘ 두 방향으로 전개되고 있다. ‘하이퍼 코피티션’은 업종, 경쟁 여부에 상관없이 글로벌 협력업체, 사업파트너까지 포함한 수평 통합(Horizontal Integration)을 구축하는 전략이다. 가전업체의 아마존 인공지능 플랫폼을 활용한 스마트 가전 개발, 자동차 메이커들의 자율주행차 개발과 관련해 데이터 처리 기술을 지닌 엔비디아, 인텔과의 협력 등이 대표적이다. ‘오픈 디지털 이노베이션’은 디지털 기술 확보를 목적으로 외부 스타트업 및 연구기관 등 외부조직과의 협업을 통해 자사의 제품 및 비즈니스의 신속한 개발을 실현하는 것이다. 지멘스는 스타트업과의 협력 실행 조직인 Next47를 설립했고, 디어앤컴퍼니(Deere & Company)는 자율주행 로봇 이벤트 후원, 농업분야 스타트업에 지분 참여를 추진하고 있다.
■ 시사점
주요국 및 선진 기업들은 이미 4차산업혁명 대응을 위한 핵심역량을 강화할 목적으로 디지털 트랜스포메이션 전략에 가용한 모든 자원을 쏟아붓고 있다. 우리 정부와 기업은 이러한 변화에 대응함은 물론 경쟁 기반 강화 및 시장 주도권 확보 등을 위한 디지털 트랜스포메이션 전략을 적극 실행해야 한다. 첫째, 운영효율화와 사업개발을 동시에 고려한 투트랙 방식의 디지털 트랜스포메이션 대응이 시급하다. 둘째, 디지털 트랜스포메이션의 비전과 실행 대상(영역)을 명확히 설정해야 한다. 셋째, 비즈니스 모델 재편, 생태계 변혁에 필요한 ICT를 확보하고 특히 외부 역량을 적극 활용하는 전략 수립이 요청된다. 넷째, 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 기획하고, 실행을 전담할 전략 조직을 상시 운영해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,복층터널 교통표지판 시인성 향상을 위한 입체표지판 설계 및 적용 가능성에 대한 연구 = A study on the design and applicability of stereoscopic sign for improving the visibility of traffic sign in double-deck tunnel,"Stereoscopic signs,Double-deck tunnel,Facility limit height,Visibility of driver,입체표지판,복층터널,시설한계고,운전자 시인성","본 연구에서는 도심지 친환경적 선진 도로교통망 구축을 위해 소형차 전용도로인 복층터널은 경제성을 확보하기 위해소형차 전용도로 단면으로(최대 높이가 3.6 m) 시설한계고를 고려하여 터널 내 교통표지판은 60 cm 이하 높이로 설계되어야 한다. 하지만 터널의 시설한계고가 낮으며, 교통표지판 문자높이가 작아 운전자 시인성 감소로 인한 판단오류가 발생될 수 있다. 따라서 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 교통표지문자를 입체적으로 설계하여 동일한 거리에서 기존 표지판보다 더 큰 시인성을 확보할 수 있는 입체표지판의 설계적용 가능성 및 가상시뮬레이션을 통한 가능성 검증을 수행하였다. 입체표지판은 복층터널 천장부에 수평으로 설치되며, 수직으로 보이기 위해서는 원근에 의해 일정한 비율로 작아지는 만큼 폭과 높이를 확대시켜 일정거리에서 수직으로 보일 수 있도록 비례식에 의한 이론적인 계산으로 입체표지판 설계를 수행하였다. 또한 입체표지판 설계제원을 통하여 운전자가 주행하였을 때 입체표지판의 시인형태를 검증하기 위해3D시뮬레이션을 수행하였다. 설계 및 실험연구를 수행한 결과 입체표지판은 이론적인 공식을 통하여 설계가 가능하였으며, 기존 수직형 교통표지판 대비 시설 한계고 제약이 없기 때문에 더 큰 교통표지문자를 운전자에게 제공할 수 있음을확인하였다. 또한 천장부에 설치된 입체표지판 설계원리를 이용하면 측벽부에서도 구현이 가능하다는 것을 확인하였다.
입체표지판 설계제원은 운전자가 정자로 시인되는 거리가 짧을수록 입체표지판 하부에 수직으로 돌출높이가 높을수록사이즈를 작게 설계가 가능하다는 것을 확인하였다. 이러한 입체표지판 설계제원을 토대로 3D시뮬레이션 주행실험결과, 계획된 일정거리에서 운전자가 입체표지판이 수직표지판과 동일한 시인 효과가 나타난 것을 확인하였다. 아직 국내외적으로 입체표지판에 대한 세부적인 연구 및 제도적인 개선이 이루어지지 않았으나, 본 연구를 통하여 개발된 입체표지판에 대한 설계 및 적용가능성을 통한 여러 연구를 통하여 새로운 도로교통시설물의 핵심기술로 발전되길 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

연구방법: 고령운전자 특성에 관한 문헌 고찰과 운전 상황 관찰 분석을 통해 고령운전자의 신체 및 인지적 특성을 반영한 내비게이션 앱 디자인 평가 프레임워크를 개발하였다. 프레임워크의 적절성을 검증하기 위해 전문가 그룹에 의해 국내의 3가지 스마트폰 내비게이션 앱을 평가하고 결과를 토의하였다.


연구결과: 프레임워크에 의한 앱 디자인 평가 결과에 의하면 국내에서 사용자 수가 가장 많은 3가지의 스마트폰 내비게이션 앱은 대체로 고령운전자의 특성을 고려하지 못하고 있는 것으로 평가되었다. 평가 프레임워크 중 신체적 능력 저하, 주의 환기 및 시공간구성 능력 저하 영역에 대한 평가 요소는 적절한 것으로 평가되었다.


결론: 고령운전자 수의 증가에 따라 스마트폰 내비게이션 앱도 고령운전자를 사용자로 포함하여야 하며 앱 개발 과정에서 사용성 평가를 할 때도 고령운전자에 대한 평가 요소가 포함되어야 한다. 본 연구에서 개발된 내비게이션 앱 디자인 평가 프레임워크는 고령운전자의 신체 및 인지적 특성을 고려함으로써 고령운전자에게 보편적 사용자 경험을 제공하기 위한 방법이 될 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,한-중 수출 구조 변화 비교와 시사점 - 대(對)세계 시장을 중심으로,,"■ 개요
최근 중국의 가격 및 비가격 경쟁력이 강화되면서 한국의 수출 경쟁력을 위협하고 있다. 최근 미-중 무역 전쟁으로 위안화 가치는 하락하고 있는 가운데, 상대적으로 원화는 지정학적 리스크 축소 등으로 하락폭이 크지 않다. 따라서 원/위안 환율이 하락하면서 중국의 가격 경쟁력이 강화되고 있다. 또한, 중국의 산업 및 기술 경쟁력이 향상되면서 한국과의 기술 격차가 축소되는 등 한국과의 산업 경쟁이 심화되고 있다. 실제로 한국-중국의 기술 격차(120개 국가전략 기술)는 2014년 1.4년에서 2016년 1.0년으로 줄어들었다. 따라서 본 보고서는 對 세계시장을 대상으로 한국과 중국의 수출 구조 변화를 비교하여 시사점을 도출하고자 한다.
■ 한-중 수출 구조 변화 비교
한국과 중국의 수출 구조 변화를 국가별, 가공단계별, 기술수준별, 수출 경합도 및 품목별 등 5개 부문으로 나누어 살펴보았다.
(국가별) 중국은 상위 5대 수출국 의존도가 낮아진 반면 한국은 일정 수준을 유지하고 있으며, 중국보다 한국이 상위 5대 수출국 구성과 순위변화가 많이 나타났다. 한국의 상위 5대 수출국 의존도가 2000년 55.3%에서 2017년 56.5%로 소폭 증가하는 가운데, 중국에 대한 의존도가 큰 폭으로 증가하고 최근에는 베트남이 상위 5대 수출국으로 진입하는 등 순위 및 의존도 변화가 일어났다. 한편 중국은 상위 5대 수출국 비중이 2000년 63.7%에서 2017년 44.9%로 축소되었으며 베트남이 최근 주요 수출국으로 진입한 점을 제외하면 그 외 국가들 순위 변동이 크지 않았다.
(가공단계별) 한-중 모두 최종재는 축소되고 중간재가 늘어나면서 가공단계별로 수출 비중의 변화는 있으나 여전히 한국은 중간재, 중국은 최종재 비중이 가장 높은 수출 구조를 유지했다. 한국은 부품·부분품을 중심으로 중간재 수출 비중이 2000년 59.8%에서 2016년 64.0%로 증가한 반면, 최종재 수출 비중은 동기간 39.8%에서 35.4%로 축소되었다. 중국도 최종재 수출 비중은 2000년 61.0%에서 2016년 56.5%로 축소되었지만 여전히 가장 높은 비중을 차지한다. 한편, 부품·부분품을 중심으로 중간재 수출 비중이 동기간 35.1%에서 42.6%로 확대되었다.
(기술 수준별) 한국의 고위기술 제조업 수출 비중은 2000년대 초반에 비해 하락한 반면 중국은 지속적으로 증가하였다. 한국은 고위기술 제조업 수출 비중은 2000년 35.8%에서 2011년 26.5%까지 축소되었으나 2016년 30.4%로 다시 증가세를 보였다. 이는 통신기기 및 부품 수출이 축소되고 있는 가운데 최근 반도체 및 트랜지스터 수출이 최근 증가하고 있기 때문이다. 중위기술 제조업은 자동차 및 부품 중심으로 비중이 2000년 32.5%에서 2016년 43.8%로 증가했다. 한편 중국은 통신기기와 반도체 및 트랜지스터 중심으로 고위기술 제조업 비중이 2000년 22.4%에서 2016년 32.6%로 증가하였다. 또한, 중위기술 제조업 수출 비중도 동기간 19.6%에서 24.8%로 증가하였다.
(수출 경합도) 한-중의 對 세계 수출 경합도 지수(ESI)가 최근 상승세를 보이고 있어 한-중간의 수출 경쟁 구도가 심화되었다. 전체 품목 뿐만 아니라 주력 8대 품목의 한중 수출 경합도 지수가 최근 상승세를 보이고 있다. 전체 품목 대상 한-중 수출 경합도 지수(對 세계 시장 대상)는 2000년 0.331에서 2016년 0.390로 상승하면서 2000년대 이후 가장 높은 수준을 기록하였고, 8대 주력 품목의 수출 경합도 지수도 2011년 이후 상승 추세를 보이면서 2016년 0.470을 기록했다.
(품목별) 8대 주력 품목 중 기계, 조선을 제외한 6개 품목의 한-중 수출 경합도 지수가 2000년 초반에 비해 상승했다. 석유화학, 철강제품, 정밀기기, 자동차의 한-중 수출 경합도 지수는 해당 품목의 주력 수출 상품 구성이 비슷해지면서 2000년 이후 지속적으로 상승하는 모습일 보였다. 철강, IT의 한-중 수출 경합도 지수는 2010년 전후로 지속적으로 상승하는 모습을 보였으나 최근 몇 년간 하락하는 모습을 보이고 있지만 2000년에 비해 높은 수준이다. 철강 부문에서 한-중 모두 주력 상품은 평판압연제품인데, 최근 중국이 이 상품의 수출 비중이 떨어지면 경합도 지수는 하락했다. 또한 IT에서는 한국의 무선통신용 장비 상품 수출 비중이 하락한 반면 중국은 크게 늘어나면서 한-중간 수출 경합도 지수가 최근 하락했다. 기계, 조선의 한-중 수출 경합도 지수는 2000년에 비해 크게 떨어졌다. 이는 한-중 모두 해당 품목의 주력 수출상품구조가 변화되었기 때문이다. 기계 부문에서는 한국의 주력 수출제품이었던 PC 부품 비중이 줄어들면서 상위 수출 품목이 비중이 고르게 분포되었다. 중국도 마찬가지로 PC 부품이 주력 수출 상품이었지만 최근 수출 비중이 축소되고 자동데이터 처리 기계가 주력 수출 상품으로 변경되면서 한-중의 수출 경합도 지수는 떨어졌다. 조선부문에서도 한국의 주력 상품이 화물선 및 화객선에서 탱커로 전환되는 반면 중국은 주력 상품이 여전히 화물선 및 화객선으로 유지하면서 탱커 수출 비중이 축소되었다.
■ 시사점
최근 중국의 가격 및 비가격 수출경쟁력이 강화되는 가운데 한국과 중국간의 수출 경합이 강화되고 있어 국내 수출 산업에 위협요인으로 작용할 가능성이 존재해 이에 대한 대비책이 필요하다. 첫째, 중장기적으로 R&D 및 설비투자 등에 대한 정책적 지원을 통해 수출경쟁력을 확보해야 한다. 둘째, 수출 시장 및 수출 품목 측면에서 수출 구조를 개선하여 수출의 부가가치를 강화하고 일부 시장 및 품목의 부진이 경제 전체에 대한 부정적 영향으로 확대되는 것을 최소화해야 한다. 셋째, 미-중 무역전쟁, 글로벌 경기 부진 가능성, 신흥국 위기 가능성 등 수출시장의 하방리스크에 적극적으로 대비해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

현성테크노가 중소 제조기업에서 글로벌 복합기업으로 도약할 수 있었던 가장 큰 이유는‘보아뱀 인수 전략’의 성공 때문이다. 현성테크노의 인수 전략은 단순한 인수 사례가 아닌 2차 협력사가 1차 협력사를 인수한 국내 사상초유의 성공 사례이다.
현성테크노는 해외현지화 전략과 보아뱀 인수 전략의 성공을 통해 1999년 연 매출 10억원에서 2017년 연 매출 223억의 기업으로, 인수한 자회사인 현성오토텍은 2005년 연 매출 50억원에서 2017년 연 매출 430억원의 기업으로 성장하였다. 또한, 현재 현성테크노는 10객 30여개의 글로벌 회사와 거래를 하고 있으며, 매출의 70%를 해외수출을 통해 이루고 있다.
오늘날, 저성장의 경제 환경 속에서 대다수 중소기업이 성장의 어려움을 겪고 있는 상황에서 본 연구는 현성테크노의 성장 과정을 창업, 해외진출, 기업인수, 사업 다각화 등으로 나누어 분석하고 이에 따른 시사점을 제시하는 데에 목적이 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,과거 미국발(發) 무역전쟁 사례와 시사점 - 미국의 환율 압박 가능성이 존재한다!,,"·개 요
과거 미국의 통상 정책은 자유무역과 보호무역을 넘나들며 추진되어 왔다. 1900년대 초반까지는 관세를 통한 보호무역주의가 우세한 반면 WTO 체제 이후에는 공정무역에 기반을 둔 무역규제 조치가 늘어나고 있다. 실질적으로 미국의 평균 관세는 1930년대 60% 수준까지 상승하는 등 높은 수준을 보였으나 WTO 체제 이후 1%대의 낮은 수준을 보였다. 그러나 2000년대 이후 세이프가드, 반덤핑 등의 무역규제건수는 급격히 증가하였다. 이에 본 보고서는 과거 주요 미국發 무역전쟁의 배경과 영향을 살펴보고, 최근 불거진 트럼프 發 무역전쟁의 배경을 과거 사례와 비교 후 시사점을 도출하고자 한다.
·과거 주요 미국發 무역전쟁 사례
1930년 이후 미국發주요 무역전쟁 사례 6가지를 살펴보면 다음과 같다.
① (1930년 스무트-홀리 법) 1930년 미국에서 스무트-홀리(Smoot Hawley Tariff Act) 법안이 제정되면서 세계 무역전쟁을 촉발시켰으며 이로 인해 국제교역 급감과 세계 대공항 심화라는 결과를 초래하였다. 미국은 경기가 어려워지자 관세를 높여 자국기업을 보호하기 위해 2만 개 이상의 수입품에 대한 최고 400%에 이르는 관세를 부과하였다. 그러나 이러한 조치로 인해 미국 경제성장률은 하락하고 무역 규모가 축소되는 등 상황은 더욱 악화되었다. 여기에 미국 관세 인상에 보복하기 위해 주요국의 경쟁적인 관세 인상이 이어지면서 세계 교역이 약 30% 감소하고 주요국의 산업 생산이 급감하는 등 세계 경제에 부정적인 결과를 초래했다.
② (1971년 닉슨 쇼크) 1971년 8월 달러화의 금태환 정지 선언과 수입 과징금 10% 부과를 포함한 신경제 정책을 발표하면서 전세계 경제에 충격을 준 닉슨 쇼크이다. 1970년대 초반 미국은 베트남 전쟁 등으로 경제 상황이 악화되었다. 당시 독일, 일본의 수출 경쟁력이 상승하고 있는 가운데 미국은 자국 산업을 보호하기 위해 관세를 부과하였고, 달러 가치가 약세를 보이면서 일본 엔화와 독일 마르크화는 각각 10%, 5% 상승하면서 이들 상품의 가격 경쟁력을 더욱 악화시켰다. 더욱이 수출에 성장 기반을 둔 한국은 닉슨 쇼크로 인해 경제성장률이 크게 낮아졌다.
③ (1985년 플라자 합의) 미국은 당시 달러 강세 문제를 해결하기 위해 1985년 9월 뉴욕에서 G5 재무장관회의를 열었으며, 합의가 채택되자 달러는 약세로 돌아섰고 독일 마르크, 일본 엔화는 강세로 전환하게 만든 1985년 플라자 합의다. 미국은 1980년대 초반에 시작된 경제 위기를 막기 위해, 달러 가치를 절하하는데 주요국과 합의했다. 이로 인해서 일본 엔화와 독일 마르크화는 달러대비 절상되었고, 특히 일본의 경상수지 흑자폭이 줄어들게 되었다. 원화의 가치도 상승했으나, 상대적으로 엔화와 마르크화에 비해 상승폭이 크지 않아 오히려 반사이익을 얻는 등 한국 경제에 미치는 영향은 크지 않았던 것으로 판단된다.
④ (1990년대 슈퍼 301조 부활) 1990년대 무역적자 해소, 정치적 지지기반 강화 등의 목적으로 미국은 한국산, 일본산 자동차에 대한 슈퍼 301조를 부활시켰다. 슈퍼 301조는 클린턴 대통령 정부 시절 일시적으로 부활하였다. 대표적으로 1994년 일본, 1997년 한국의 자동차 시장에 슈퍼 301조를 적용하는 사례가 있었다.
⑤ (2002년 철강 세이프가드) 2002년 미국 통상법 201조(세이프가드)를 발동하여 수입 철강재에 관세를 부과하는 조치를 발표했으나 무역상대국 반발 등으로 조기 철회되었다. 세이프가드는 미국의 자국내 철강 산업 보호와 정치적 기반 강화를 위한 조치였다. 이로 인해 주요국들이 WTO에 제소했고 미국 상품에 대한 보복 조치에 대한 논의가 있어 무역전쟁 확대가 우려되었다. 그러나 미국은 WTO에서 패소 판정을 받아 이 조치는 철회되었다.
⑥ (글로벌 금융위기 시기 무역정책) 2008년 금융위기 이후 미국은 경제를 재건하기 위해 많은 부양책과 수출 확대 정책을 펼쳤다. 그 과정에서 미국은 양적완화와 초저금리 조치로 글로벌 달러 약세, 글로벌 불균형 등으로 환율 전쟁 우려가 확산되었다. 또한 국제 조약 의무 준수하에 수출 확대를 추진하였고 불공정 무역 감시, 무역상대국으로의 무역구제 조치를 강화했다. 이로 인한 한국의 경우, 미국의 對 한국신규 수입 규제 건수가 오바마 재임 시절에 가장 많이 증가했다.
·트럼프發 무역전쟁과의 비교
이상 살펴 본 바와 같이 과거 미국發 무역전쟁에서 공통적으로 나타나는 특징은, 미국 경제 침체기 및 국제수지 악화, 달러 강세 방지, 주요 무역 경쟁국 견제, 정치적 지지기반 강화 등 4가지이다. 과거 사례를 트럼프發 무역전쟁과 비교하여 다음과 같은 특징이 도출되었다.
① 트럼프發 무역전쟁은 자유무역을 추진하면서 미국의 무역 적자가 확대되었고, 이로 인해 제조업 경쟁력이 약화되고 일자리가 감소되었다는 논리로 시작했으며 경기침체기는 아니라는 점에서 과거 사례와 차이를 보인다. 최근 미국경기는 확장세를 이어가고 있는 가운데 실업률은 완전고용 수준에 가깝다. 다만 자유무역협정을 통해 오히려 미국의 무역수지는 악화되었다.
② 결과적으로 트럼프 대통령도 미국의 국제수지 악화를 막기 위해 다양한 보호무역정책을 추진하고 있으나, 과거 사례와 마찬가지로 미국發 보호무역주의가 세계경제에 부정적일 것이라는 견해가 지배적이다. 최근 트럼프는 세이프가드 등 관세 인상을 통해 보호무역을 강화하고 있으나 이로 인해 무역 비용 증가, 교역량 감소로 인한 세계 경제 피해가 예상되고 있다.
③ 과거 사례와 비슷하게 관세 인상, 무역 제재 등이 정치적 수단으로 이용될 가능성이 크고, 경쟁 대상국의 견제 수단으로 사용되나 중국의 경제 규모를 고려하면 영향력 행사가 쉽지 않은 상황이다. 올해 11월 중간선거가 있어 선거 공약에 대한 결과가 필요한 시점이고, 최근 미중간의 무역전쟁이 심화되고 있으나 세계 경제의 위상 측면에서 본다면 중국이 쉽게 물러나지는 않을 것이다.
④ 과거 무역제재와 함께 미국은 달러화 약세를 유도하면서 국제수지 악화를 막기 위한 노력을 해왔다. 그러나 최근 달러 강세 요인들이 우세한 상황에서 달러화가 강세로 갈 경우 미국의 환율 압박은 심화될 수 있다. 미국의 금리인상 가속 등으로 달러 강세 요인들이 우세한 입장에서 트럼프의 통상 정책을 추진하기 위해서는 달러 약세가 필요하다.
이와 같이 트럼프發 무역전쟁은 과거 미국發 무역전쟁처럼 국제수지 악화, 주요 무역 경쟁국 견제, 정치적 지지기반 강화 등의 배경은 유사하지만 경기침체기는 아니라는 점에서 차이를 보인다. 또한 달러 강세 방지는 향후 달러가치의 향방에 따라 미국은 추후 달러 약세 압력을 행사할 가능성이 존재한다.

트럼프發 통상전쟁이 세계 경제에 심각한 타격뿐만 아니라 국내 실물경제에 악영향을 미칠 가능성에 대한 우려도 확산되고 있는 가운데 향후 환율에 대한 압박이 예상되므로 이에 대한 대응이 필요하다. 첫째, 미국의 보호무역 정책 및 통상분쟁에 대해 주변 국가와의 국제 공조 등을 통해 효율적으로 대응해야 한다. 둘째, 미국 환율압박에 따른 ‘新환율전쟁’과 약달러 정책에 따른 가격 경쟁력 약화에 대비해 외환시장 안정화, 비가격 경쟁력 강화 등이 필요하다. 셋째, 미국發 무역전쟁이 세계 경제에 리스크 요인으로 작용할 가능성에 대비하여 위험을 사전에 차단해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,2018년 하반기 경제 이슈,,"·개 요
최근 경기 흐름에 불확실성이 내재되어 있다. 향후에는 경기 상승의 모멘텀보다는 하강 리스크가 더 많아 보인다. 이에 2018년도 하반기 한국 경제에서 쟁점으로 부상할 만한 7가지 이슈를 선정하고 대응 방안을 모색하고자 한다.
① (경기, 다운사이클 논쟁) 공급 주도에서 수요(소득) 주도로 경제 정책의 패러다임을 전환한 이후 정책 효과가 나타나는 시점이 다가오면서 경기 흐름에 대한 논란이 예상된다. 경제성장률은 큰 폭의 등락을 보여 경기 판단이 쉽지 않은 상황이다. 그러나 고용 부문의 심각한 둔화, 비관적으로 판단하는 경제 주체들의 증가 및 경기 수축을 예고하는 선행지수 등을 고려하면 향후 경기 회복세가 지속될 것인지 장담하기 어려운 상황이다.
② (내수 기반의 균열 우려) 2018년 하반기 가계대출 확대, 대출금리 인상에 따르는 원리금 상환 부담 증가, 고용시장 위축 가능성 등으로 가계의 소비여력 축소 여부가 이슈가 될 전망이다. 2016년 4분기 이후 국내 경제성장률에서 민간소비의 기여도가 꾸준히 증가하여 민간소비가 최근 경기 개선에 중요한 역할을 했다. 그러나 소비자심리지수가 2017년 4분기 이후 둔화세로 돌아서면서 향후 소비 확대 지속 여부가 우려된다. 또한 2018년 들어 신규취업자수가 급감하는 등 고용시장 악화로 향후 가계소득이 감소할 가능성이 높아지고 있다. 더욱이 가계부채 규모가 꾸준히 증가 추세에 있는 가운데 시장금리 인상에 따른 가계의 원리금상환액 부담 증가가 소비 위축이 우려된다.
③ (수출의 양극화와 취약성) 국내 수출의 과도한 반도체 수출 의존, 신흥국경기 불안, 보호무역주의 움직임 등 내부 불균형 요인이 있고 외부 충격에 취약한 상태이다. 우리나라의 수출 구조가 지나치게 반도체에 편중되어 있어 향후 전체수출 경기는 반도체 산업의 향방에 좌우될 가능성이 높다. 미국의 기준금리 인상 과정에서 아르헨티나, 터키, 브라질 등 취약 신흥국을 중심으로 경제 위기 우려가 불거지고 있다. 미국과 중국의 무역 갈등은 중국의 대미국 무역흑자 축소, 지식재산권 침해해소 등 큰 틀의 합의는 이루었으나 구체적인 방안에서는 여전히 이견이 존재한다.
④ (고용시장 동상이몽(同床異夢)) 최근 취업자수 증가폭이 10만명대 초반 수준으로 급감한 상황에서 정부의 정책적 지원 강화에도 불구하고 고용비용 증가, 산업 구조조정 등 악화 요인이 혼재해 있어 고용시장 개선은 쉽지 않을 것으로 예상된다. 최근 실업률은 4%대 전후, 고용률은 60%대 전후로 기존 수준을 유지하고 있으나, 2018년 4월 취업자수 증가폭이 전년동기대비 12.3만명으로 3개월 연속 10만명대 초반 수준을 기록하며 고용시장이 악화되었다. 이러한 상황에서 공공부문 일자리 창출, 청년 일자리 추경 집행 및 중국인 관광객 수 회복 등 고용시장 개선 요인이 일부 존재한다. 그러나 자동차 산업 구조조정으로 인한 제조업 고용 위축, 건설 경기둔화에 따른 건설부문 취업자수 증가폭 축소 등 고용시장 악화 요인이 산재해 있어 정부의 정책적 지원 확대에도 불구하고 고용시장 개선은 쉽지 않을 것으로 예상된다.
⑤ (달러화 방향성의 불확실성 확대) 기대 인플레이션 상승으로 미국 금리 인상 가속화 우려가 확산되고 있는 가운데 국제 금융시장의 변동성이 확대되고, 달러화 향방도 불확실성이 커질 것으로 예상된다. 최근 국제 유가가 상승하고 양호한 미국 경제 흐름을 바탕으로 기대 인플레이션이 3%를 기록했다. 여기에 美 국채금리가 3%를 넘어서면서 올해 미국 정책 금리 4회 인상 가능성이 40%를 넘었다. 이로 인해 최근 달러화가 강세로 돌아섰다. 미국 금리 인상 가속화로 주요국과 금리차가 확대되는 등 달러 강세 지속 요인도 있지만, 약달러 선호, 재정지출 확대 등으로 향후 달러 약세 요인도 상존하고 있어 달러의 향방을 예측하기 어려운 상황이다.
⑥ (흔들리는 신흥국) 대외 리스크에 노출된 신흥국의 위기 점검 결과, 6개 국가가 고위험군으로 분류되고 특히 아르헨티나와 터키의 위험이 증가하면서 통화가치가 하락세를 보이고 있다. 글로벌 통화정책 긴축, 국제 원자재 가격 상승, 지정학적 리스크 등 대외 리스크가 확대되면서 특히 신흥국을 중심으로 위기 발생 가능성에 대한 우려가 심화되고 있다. 현재 시점에서 신흥국의 위기발생 가능성을 점검해본 결과, 재정수지, 정부부채가 신흥국을 취약하게 하는 주요 위기 지표로 나타났으며 고위험군에 속하는 국가의 수는 6개로 2016년과 동일했다. 고위험군에 속한 국가 중에서 특히 아르헨티나와 터키의 위험도가 2016년보다 악화되면서 이 두 국가를 중심으로 신흥국 위기설이 다시 부상하고 있다.
⑦ (국제 유가 스텝업(step-up)) 최근 국제 유가가 상승세를 보이고 있으며 향후 국제 원유 시장에서는 원유에 대한 초과수요가 예상되어 국제유가 상승세는 지속될 것으로 전망된다. 최근 중동지역 지정학적 리스크 부각 등으로 5월 국제 유가가 배럴당 70달러대에 진입하는 등 유가는 상승세를 보이고 있다. 향후 원유 시장은 2018년 글로벌 경기 회복세 등으로 원유 소비가 증가하는 동시에 OPEC 감산 합의에 참여하지 않는 국가에서 생산이 증대할 것으로 예상되는 등 공급도 증가할 것으로 전망된다. 국제 원유 수급은 2017년 이후부터 초과공급에서 초과수요로 전환되었다. 2018년에는 글로벌 경기 회복세, 중동지역 지정학적 리스크 등으로 초과수요 상황이 지속될 것으로 예상되어 유가 상승 압력으로 작용할 것으로 전망된다. 즉, 유가 상승요인이 하락 요인보다 우세하여 향후 국제유가 상승세는 지속될 것으로 예측된다.

2018년 하반기에 부각될 이슈에 대응하기 위해서 다음과 같은 대응책이 필요하다. 첫째, 경기 판단에 얽매이기 보다는 경기 활성화 정책 시행 및 경제 구조 개혁 노력을 지속해야 한다. 둘째, 국내 경기 개선세를 이어가기 위해서는 적극적 고용시장 정책 확대, 금리인상 충격 완화 등을 통해 가계소비 위축을 막아야 한다. 셋째, 수출품목의 다변화를 지속적으로 추진하고 수요가 늘고 있는 신흥시장을 적극적으로 공략해야 한다. 넷째, 산업 경쟁력을 강화하고 기업의 투자 확대를 유도하여 경제 전반의 고용 창출력 회복에 주력해야 한다. 다섯째, 미국의 금리 인상 가속화 등에 따르는 글로벌 경제 및 금융 리스크에 대응할 수 있는 방안 마련이 필요하다. 여섯째, 위험가능성이 커지고 있는 신흥국에 대해서는 모니터링을 통해 위험 발생 가능성에 선제적으로 대응해야 한다. 일곱째, 국제유가 상승에 대비한 모니터링 및 리스크 헷징 전략을 마련하는 한편 중장기적으로 유가 충격에 취약한 경제구조를 개선해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,2018년 하반기 기업 경영환경 전망 및 시사점,,"□ 2018년 하반기 기업 경영환경 전망 및 시사점
■ 개 요
2017년 국내 경기는 글로벌 경기 회복 및 정치적 리스크 해소 등으로 반등했고 2018년 상반기에도 경제성장률 3% 이상의 양호한 흐름이 나타났다. 그러나 하반기에는 글로벌 경기 하강 조짐, 내수경기 하방 리스크 확대 등 국내외 불안 요인이 대두되면서 경기 침체 가능성이 확대되었다. 본 보고서에서는 설문조사를 통해 국내 주요 기업이 하반기 국내외 경제 상황 및 기업 경영을 어떻게 인식하고 있는지 파악하고 시사점을 도출한다.
■ 2018년 하반기 국내외 경제 및 이슈
(2018년 하반기 국내외 경제 전망) 기업들은 하반기 세계 경제는 상반기와 비슷할 것으로 예상한다. 약 80%에 이르는 응답자가 하반기 세계 경제는 상반기와 비슷할 것이라고 응답했다. 다만 많은 기업들이 미국발 무역전쟁이 가장 우려되는 세계경제 불안요인이라고 지적했다. 미국발 무역전쟁(54.5%)과 미국의 금리 인상 가속화(30.3%)가 세계 경제의 주요 불안요인이라고 응답한 기업들이 가장 많았다.
하반기 국내 경제는 ‘2%대 후반’의 성장률을 기록할 것으로 전망하는 기업의 비중이 가장 높았다. 그러나 한국경제가 침체 국면에 진입했다는 분석에 대해 다수 기업이 동의한다고 응답했다. 한편 국내 경제에 부담을 줄 하방 리스크 요인으로 금리인상, 투자 위축이 지적되었다. 그 외에 소비부진, 고용시장 개선세 미약, 가계부채 등의 응답 또한 각각 10% 내외를 차지했다.
(최근 경제 및 경영 이슈) 국내 기업들은 정부 정책 중 가장 잘하고 있는 분야로 통상 정책과 부동산 시장 및 가계 대출 규제라는 응답이 각각 24.5% 씩으로 가장 큰 비중을 차지했다. 그 외에 혁신성장, 산업 구조조정 정책 등이 그 뒤를 이었다. 정부 정책 중 가장 못하고 있는 분야로는 규제정책이라는 응답이 25.6%로 가장 많았다. 그 외에는 노동정책, 일자리 정책 등의 순으로 나타났다.
정부의 現노동 정책에 대해 기업들의 우려가 다소 높은 상황이며, 특히 최저임금 인상에 대해 완급 조절이 필요하다고 응답했다. 정부의 노동정책이 기업의 경영활동에 미치는 영향에 대해 93.9%가 부정적인 영향을 미칠 것이라고 응답했다. 근로시간 단축 시행으로 가장 우려되는 점은 가이드라인 미제시 등에 따른 혼란이라는 기업이 가장 많았다. 최저임금 인상으로 응답기업의 54.5%가 비용 부담 증가가 우려된다고 응답했다. 그리고 응답기업의 96.0%가 최저임금 인상과 관련해 속도조절이 필요하다고 응답했다.
하반기 경영변수 중 국내 기업들에 가장 부담을 주는 요인으로 親勞 정책을 꼽았으며, 남북 관계 개선으로 인한 경제 주체 심리가 개선될 것으로 보고 있다. 하반기 경영변수 중 가장 우려되는 것으로 최저임금 인상, 근로시간 단축 등 親勞정책을 지적한 기업이 37.8%로 가장 많았으며 글로벌 보호무역 기승, 긴축에 따른 시장 금리 상승 등의 이슈 또한 각각 26.5%, 20.4%식 지적되었다. 또한 한반도 지정학적 리스크 완화로 경제 주체 심리가 개선될 것으로 본다고 응답한 기업은 86.9%를 차지했다.
■ 2018년 상반기 경영실적 평가 및 하반기 경영환경 전망
(상반기 경영실적 평가) 절반 가량에 해당하는 48.0%의 기업들은 상반기 경영실적은 연초에 예상했던 수준을 유지했다. 예상을 상회하는 성과를 거둔 기업들은 주된 이유로 내수부진을 언급했다. 반면 경영실적이 예상보다 부진했던 기업들 또한 내수 부진을 주요 원인으로 지적해 기업에 따라 체감 내수경기가 상이함을 시사했다.
(하반기 경영 계획) 주요 기업들은 2018년 하반기에 상반기와 비슷한 수준의 경영계획을 수립할 것이라고 응답했으며 응답한 기업의 56.7%가 ‘수익성 향상’을 하반기 기업 활동의 우선순위로 둔다고 응답했다. 하반기 경영목표에 대해 매출과 영업이익은 상반기에 비해 소폭 증대시킬 것을 계획했으며 설비투자, R&D, 신규고용은 상반기 수준을 유지할 계획이라고 응답했다. 하반기 기업활동 우선순위에 대해서는 수익성 향상, 매출 증대가 각각 56.7%, 16.5%로 가장 큰 비중을 차지했다. 기업들의 하반기 자금 사정은 상반기와 비슷한 수준을 유지할 것으로 예상한 비중이 가장 높았다.
(대외 환경 전망) 원/달러 환율 및 국제유가는 상반기와 유사한 수준에서 형성될 것이라고 전망하는 비중이 가장 높았다. 환율은 상반기와 비슷한 1,000원 이상~1,100원 미만에서 형성될 것이라는 응답이 58.6%로 가장 많았고 1,100원 이상~1,200원 미만에서 형성될 것이라는 응답은 41.4%를 차지했으며 1,000원 미만으로 하락하거나 1,200원 이상으로 상승할 가능성은 낮을 것으로 예상했다. 하반기 평균 유가는 상반기와 유사한 수준인 60달러 이상~70달러 미만을 예상한 기업은 66.7%, 70달러 이상~80달러 미만을 예상한 기업은 29.2%를 차지했다.
(하반기 기업투자지수) 국내 주요 기업들의 2018년 하반기 투자 종합지수는 2018년 상반기 대비 하락했으며, 특히 투자 실적, 투자 성과, 투자 여건 지수가 큰 폭으로 하락한 것으로 조사되었다. 투자 종합지수가 2018년 상반기 135.6p에서 2018년 하반기 112.5p로 하락했다. 산업별 지수를 살펴보면 정유/석유화학 산업의 투자지수가 150.0p로 가장 높게 나타난 반면 건설, 자동차, 운송, 금융, 기타 산업의 투자지수는 산업 평균을 하회했다.

첫째, 정부는 시장과의 소통을 강화하여 정부 및 정책에 대한 기업들의 우려를 불식시키고, 투자 활성화 및 성장 정책을 지속적으로 추진하여 경기 회복세를 강화할 필요가 있다. 둘째, 미국發 무역전쟁, 주요 선진국 금리 인상에 따른 신흥국 위기 가능성 등 대외 리스크에 대한 대비를 강화해야 한다. 셋째, 최근 경기 회복세를 견인해 왔던 내수 경기가 침체에 빠지지 않도록 대응하고 수출 취약성, 가계부채 등 대내적 불확실성 요인을 차단해야 한다",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,테일러상회의 무역 활동과 가구 - 전통가구의 변화 양상을 중심으로 = The trading and furniture by Taylor & Co. : Focusing on the modification of Korean Traditional Furniture,"Taylor & Co.,trade,furniture,crafts,export,Dilkusha,modification,Westernized Japanese furniture,the eclectic style of Korean and the West,테일러상회,무역,가구,공예,수출,딜쿠샤,변형,화양가구,한양절충","개항 이후 쏟아져 들어온 서구의 여러 문명 소비재들은 근대적 삶으로 편입하는 기폭제가 되었다. 처음에는 조선에 거주하는 외국인들을 대상으로 일종의 잡화점 형태의 상점들이 생겨났지만, 시장의 수요가 늘자 점차 전문 상회들이 들어섰다. 소공동에 위치한 테일러상회(W.W.TAYLOR & COMPANY)는 1910년대부터 해방 전까지 활발하게 활동한 종합 무역 상사로, 서구로부터 자동차, 각종 생활 잡화·악기·건축 및 인테리어 용품을 수입했고, 세계 최대의 우편통신판매업체인 몽고메리 워드사(Montgomery Ward & Co.)를 대행했다. 뿐만 아니라 조선의 가구와 공예품을 조선을 방문하는 외국인들을 대상으로 판매했고 해외 여러 곳으로도 수출했다. 테일러상회의 무역활동은 수입과 수출 양방향에서 활발했지만 수출과 관련해서는 조선 가구 분야가 가장 큰 비중을 차지했다. 이는 테일러상회가 발행한 영문 안내서를 통해서 구체적으로 확인할 수 있다.
테일러상회의 영문 안내서는 두 종류로 파악된다. 첫째가 『옛 골동품상(Ye Old Curio Shop)』(1921)이고, 두 번째가 『한국 것에 대한 이야기(Chats on Things Korean)』(연도미상)이다. 이 책들은 조선의 역사·풍습·문화에 대한 전반적인 내용을 담은 여행 안내서인 동시에 테일러상회에서 판매하는 각종 가구와 유기·불상·도자기·호박 액세서리·호랑이 가죽 등을 소개하는 상품 도록의 역할을 했다. 테일러상회 에서 판매한 가구는 크게 고가구와 ‘모던 가구’로 분류할 수 있다. 고가구 중에서 가장 높은 비중을 차지하는 것이 삼층장과 반닫이고, 이는 외국인들이 가장 선호한 품목이었다. ‘모던 가구’에 속하는 것에는 오래된 목재나 반닫이를 활용하여 새로운 형태의 가구를 짜고 놋쇠를 교체한 ‘세미 모던’ 가구와 새로운 디자인으로 제작한 것도 있었다. 번쩍번쩍하게 화려한 장석을 붙인 이러한 가구들은 미국인의 취향에 맞춘 것으로, 이에 대해 일부에서는 비판의 목소리도 있었다. ‘포퓰러 캐비닛(POPULAR CABINET)’, ‘프린세스 캐비닛(PRINCESS CABINET)’, ‘갑게수리(KAP-KE-SOO-RI)’ 와 같은 이름을 달고 팔린 테일러상회의 모던 가구는 전통적인 장·농·반닫이의 형식을 일본과 서구의 가구 양식을 혼합, 변형하여 작고 아담한 것으로 재탄생 된 것이 주를 이루었다.
이러한 것들은 해외 여러 박물관·백화점·찻집 등의 상업 공간으로 수출되었다. ‘조선단스(朝鮮簞?)’로 대변되는 개화기 의류 수납가구는 개항 이후 조선에 자리한 일본의 화양가구 업체의 영향이 컸다. 그러나 전통을 유지하되 실용성과 장식성을 높인 테일러상회의 모던 가구들은 전통가구의 변화 요인이 단지 화양가구 일변도가 아니라 시장의 다양한 요구에 따른 것이었음을 보여준다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,자율주행차 사고와 책임보험:  ADS Entity의 책임이 미치는 영향 = Automated Vehicle Accidents and Liability Insurance: The Implication of an ADS Entity’s Liabilities,"자율주행차 사고,책임보험,운전자책임,운행자책임,제조물책임,자율주행시스템,시스템후견인(ADS Entity),역동적 운전작업,보유자,운행자,운행지배,운행이익,제조자,제조물,Autonomous Vehicle Accident,Liability Insurance,Driver Liability,Operator Liability,Product Liability,ADS(automated driving system),ADS Entity,DDT(dynamic driving task),Owner,Operator,Control,Benefits,Maker,Product","자율주행차에서는 역동적 운전작업을 포함해 자동차 조작행위를 인간 운전자 뿐아니라 로봇운전자인 자율주행시스템 ADS(Automated Driving System)가 담당하게 된다. 이제 운전개념은 더이상 ‘인간’ 운전자의 행위에 한정되는 것이 아니고, 로봇 운전자‘ADS’의 운전작업으로 확장되고, 운전자책임은 ADS의 작동에 대한 책임으로 확장되게된다. 그런데, ADS는 사람이 아니라 “하드웨어와 소프트웨어의 집합체”에 불과하므로, 법상 권리주체가 될 수 없다. 이러한 문제점을 극복하기 위해 ADS의 운전행위에 대해 ADS 대신 책임을 지는 주체인 ADS Entity (ADSE) 개념이 고안되었다. 이 개념을 채택하는 경우 ADS의 운전행위에 대해서는 ADSE가 대신 운전자책임을 지게 된다.
이 글에서는 먼저 자율차 사고와 관련해 발생하는 민사책임에 대해 살펴보았는데, 첫째, 운전자와 ADSE의 운전주의와 관련한 운전자책임에 대하여 살펴보았다. 다음으로, 보유자와 ADSE가 지는 운행자책임에 대해 살펴보았다. ADSE는 자신이 후원하는ADS를 통해 자율주행차동차의 ‘운행을 지배’하고 또 ‘운행으로 인한 이익’을 향유하는것으로 볼 수 있으므로 ADSE는 보유자와 더불어 자율차의 공동운행자가 될 수 있다.
끝으로 ADSE가 ADS 제조업자로서 지는 제조물책임에 대해 살펴보았다. ADS 혹은자율차를 제조, 가공, 수입한 제조업자가 ADSE가 되는 경우, ADSE는 ADS의 결함에대해 제조업자 혹은 표시제조업자로서 제조물책임을 질 수 있다.
다음으로, 이러한 자율차사고 책임에 대하여 현행 책임보험제도를 적용할 때 현행제도가 자율차사고의 위험과 책임을 잘 커버하고 있는지 여부를 검토해 보았다. 특히, 자율주행차에서 새로이 발생하는 ADS의 운전작용에 대한 ADSE의 운전자책임, ADSE 의 운행자책임 등 새로운 책임 측면에 대하여 현행 자배법상 책임보험이 어떻게 적용될수 있는지를 분석해 보았다.
마지막으로 ADS의 운전작용에 대한 ADSE의 위험을 커버하기 위해 현행 책임보험제도가 어떻게 개선되어야 할 것인가에 대해 살펴보았다. 현재 SAE 3단계 자동화기술수준에서는 ADS가 운전하는 자율차의 운행지배를 여전히 ‘근원적’ 점유를 갖는 자율차보유자에게 있다고 보는 관점이 유효할 수 있다. 따라서, SAE 3단계 기술의 상용화를고민하는 현재로서는 현행 보유자의 의무책임보험 제도를 유지 개선하거나, 아니면ADSE의 의무보험자지위 선택권을 인정하는 방법이 타당해 보인다. 이러한 방안을 채택할 경우, 종전처럼 자율차보유자의 책임보험 가입의무를 전제로 ADSE는 보유자가가입한 책임보험의 종피보험자 지위를 부여받을 수 있고, 이 경우 상당한 보험료 지급의무를 지게 되고, 아니면 자신의 선택에 따라 의무보험자 지위를 선택할 수 있게 된다.
하지만 SAE 4단계 이상의 자율차에 대해서는 ADS를 통한 ADSE의 ‘주도적’, ‘직접적’ 운행지배가 보유자의 점유보다 더 현저해지므로, ADSE를 책임보험의 의무가입자로 법정해야 할 압력이 높아질 것이다. 따라서, 4단계 이상의 자율차에 대해서는 ADSE 의 의무가입자 지위를 법정해야 할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,음주측정불응죄와 미국의 묵시적동의법의 비교 고찰 ― 위헌성 문제를 중심으로 ― = A Comparative Study on Implied Consent Law in the US and Crime of Refusal to Take a Breath Test in Korea ― Focusing on Constitutionality ―,"Implied Consent Law,Crime of Refusal to Take Breath Test,Privilege against Self Incrimination,Blood Test,Breath Test,Exigent Circumstances Exception,묵시적 동의법,음주측정불응죄,자기부죄거부권,혈액측정,호흡측정,긴급상황의 예외이론","미국 대부분의 주는 공공도로에서 차량을 운행하는 모든 운전자가 음주측정을 위한 화학적 검사(chemical test)에 동의한 것으로 본다는 묵시적 동의법(implied consent)을 입법하고 있다. 그런데 종래, 미연방대법원에서는 묵시적 동의법에 기초한 운전자에 대한 동의 없는 채혈이 수정헌법 제5조의 자기부죄거부의 특권(privilege against self incrimination)을 침해한 것인지, 그리고 불합리한 수색과 압수(unreasonable search and seizure)를 금지한 수정헌법 제4조의 위반인지 여부가 논란이 되어 왔다.
우리의 경우 도로교통법에서 음주측정불응을 형사처벌하고 있다. 음주측정불응죄는 도로교통법이 1961년 제정될 당시에는 없었으나, 1980년 도로교통법 개정과 함께 신설되었다. 80년대 들어 자동차가 증가하고 음주운전이 사회적 문제로 대두하였으나, 음주운전 단속시 운전자들이 음주측정을 거부하는 사례가 빈발하자 이에 대한 대책으로 음주측정불응죄가 입법된 것이다. 그 후 개정을 거치면서 음주측정불응죄의 처벌범위가 확대되어 왔다. 미국의 묵시적 동의법이나 우리의 도로교통법상 음주측정불응죄의 취지는 대동소이하다. 음주운전의 위험성에 따라 음주운전의 예방 및 효과적인 단속을 위한 것이다. 따라서, 상당한 이유가 있는 경우 음주측정은 허용되어야 하고, 운전자들도 이에 따를 필요가 있다. 문제는 음주측정불응행위를 과연 형사처벌 대상으로 할 것인가이다. 음주측정불응죄를 형사처벌하는 것은 헌법상 자기부죄거부권, 영장주의, 적법절차 원칙의 침해라는 문제를 야기한다. 음주운전 자체와 별도로 음주측정불응행위를 형사처벌의 대상으로 삼는 것은 형법의 보충성의 원칙과 영장주의나 적법절차 원칙에 비추어 타당하지 않은 측면도 있다.
이러한 미국의 묵시적 동의법과 도로교통법상 음주측정불응죄는 헌법상 자기부죄거부특권이나 영장주의 위반 여부가 문제된다는 공통점이 있다. 본 논문에서는 미국의 묵시적 동의법과 우리의 음주측정불응죄를 비교고찰하면서, 미국의 묵시적 동의법에 관한 미연방대법원 판례가 우리의 법해석과 입법에 주는 시사점을 검토하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

두 번째, 화재예방 훈련 및 화재발생에 대비한 대응훈련을 강화하였다. 예방활동은 화재발생을 억제하는 활동이었다. 출초식은 연초에 실시되는 소방조의 중요한 행사였다. 출초식을 통하여 소방조는 그해 활동의지를 다짐하였다. 봄?가을 실시되는 춘?추계 소방훈련에는 소방조원들은 자동차펌프를 활용하여 훈련을 실시하였다. 매년 겨울철에는 시행되는 ‘방화데이’에는 불조심 캠페인 등을 실시하였다.
화재가 발생하면 부산소방조는 신속한 현장대응활동도 전개하였다. 부산소방조는 망루감시와 공중전화, 화재보지기를 통하여 화재를 탐지하였다. 화재발견시 상비소방수들은 신속하게 자동차 펌프에 탑승하여 출동하였다. 그러나 부산소방조의 화재대응활동은 본정을 중심으로 한 일본인 거주지 중심으로 전개되었다. 최신장비도 일본인 거주지에 배치되었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,미국문화사 강의에서의 소설과 영화의 활용 - 1920년대 재즈 시대를 중심으로 - = The Use of Novel and Film Texts in the Cultural History Class of America,,"이 논문은 소설과 영화 작품을 활용하여 효과적인 미국 문화사 교육 방안을 모색해 보는데 그 목적이 있다. F. S. 피츠제럴드의 소설 『위대한 개츠비』와 배즈 루어먼 감독의 영화 <위대한 개츠비>는 뛰어난 문학성과 예술성을 인정받은 문예 작품이기도 하지만 또 한편으로는 재즈 시대 또는 광란의 시대라고 일컫는 1920년대 미국의 사회상을 보여주는 좋은 텍스트이기도 하다.
이러한 점에 착안하여 이 논문에서는 재즈 음악, 폭스트롯과 찰스턴 댄스, 음주와 흡연, 화려한 파티, 짧은 치마를 입고 단발머리에 짙은 화장을 한 신여성 플래퍼의 등장, 그리고 자동차 문화 등으로 대변되는 1920년대의 미국 문화사를 강의할 때 효과적인 교육을 위하여 소설 작품 『위대한 개츠비』와 동명의 영화 작품을 활용하는 방안을 제시해 보았다.
길드 에이지에 구축된 기간 산업을 바탕으로 1920년대부터 본격적인 산업사회로 접어든 미국은 소비재의 대량 생산이 가능해졌다. 비약적인 발전 덕택에 기업은 엄청난 부를 축적하였고 이것은 개인에게 분배되어 미국은 바야흐로 대중 소비사회로 접어들게 되었다. 이러한 사회 변동과 더불어 1차 세계 대전이 끝난 후 젊은이들을 중심으로 미국인들은 정신적 방황을 겪었다. 이른바 길잃은 세대라고 불린 이 시기의 미국인들은 전통적인 청교도 풍의 기성 질서에 대하여 반기를 들면서 도덕적인 타락과 환락에 빠져들기 시작했다.
이러한 1920년대 미국 사회의 모습은 소설과 영화 작품으로도 소개되었는데 대표적인 사례가 바로 앞서 언급한 피츠제럴드의 소설 『위대한 개츠비』이며 그것을 영화로 만든 사례 가운데 최근 것이 바로 배즈 루어먼 감독의 작품이다. 이들은 각 장르의 특성, 즉 스토리텔링과 이미지텔링의 강점을 살려 기존 도덕과 질서가 붕괴된 1920년대 미국의 사회상을 생생하게 보여준다. 그러므로 문화사 강의에서도 이러한 점을 활용한다면 학생들의 흥미와 관심을 유발하여 교육 효과를 높일 수 있을 것이다. 하지만 역사 분야의 전문가가 아닌 소설가와 영화 감독이 만든 문예 작품이므로 역사적 사실에 대한 신뢰성을 담보하기는 어렵다.
그럼에도 불구하고 문화사 강의에 있어서 소설과 영화를 활용해야 할 필요는 충분하다. 그 이유는 스토리텔링과 이미지 매체에 익숙한 신세대 학생들의 교육 현장에서는 소설과 영화를 이용하는 것이 기대 이상으로 효과적이기 때문이다. 따라서 문화사 강의의 보조 자료로서 소설과 영화를 활용하는 것은 권장되어야 하며 또한 효과적 활용 방안에 관하여 후속 연구가 이어지기를 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

영국은 이를 위하여 차량 압류 절차를 적극 활용하고 있다. 즉 FEO라고 불리는 집행관과 contractor라고 불리는 담당관은 과태료 미납자에 대하여 압류명령을 직접적으로 집행하는 역할을 담당하고 있으며 당해 절차를 통하여 종국적으로 미납된 과태료를 충당하여 과태료본래의 목적으로 어렵지 않게 달성하고 있다. 물론 당해 절차는 상당 정도 면밀하게 도모되고 있으며 각 단계별로 당사자에게 이의신청 기회를 주는 등 당사자의 권리 보장에도 만전을 기하고 있다. 우리 역시 과태료 징수율의 제고에 난항을 겪고 있어서 과태료 제도의 제도적 의의를 확보하기 위해서는 우선 과태료 징수 혹은 집행절차의 개선이 도모되어야 한다. 특히 경미한 법위반에 대하여 부괴되는 과태료의 제도적 의의를 고려한다면 자동차 압류 절차는 우리에게도 시사하는 바가 상당하며 특히 우리는 질서위반행위규제법을 통하여 과태료에 대한 전반적인 사항이 도모되고 있다는 점에서 당해 법률에 관련 사항을 규정할 수 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

전 규정에서 130gCO2/km인 유럽연합의 승용차 CO2 배출성능요건은 2019년에 개정되면서 95gCO2/km로 강화되었다. 이 규정은 유럽연합 역외 승용차 제조업체들도 그 적용 대상에 포함하고 있으며, Eco-innovation등을 사용하며 추가적인 CO2 배출량을 감축한 승용차 제조업체들은 Super Credits등을 부여 받게 하여 감축기술에 대한 단기적인 보상이 이루어지게 하고 있다. 하지만 장기적인 CO2 배출량 감축 기술의 발전과 적용을 통해 승용차 CO2 배출량감축을 기대하기 위해서는 장기적인 측면에서의 CO2 배출량 감축에 대한 보상은 반드시 제공되어야 한다. 이를 위해 규정 내 인센티브 관련 구체적인 조항들의 마련이 필요해 보인다.
실제 CO2 배출량과 공인 CO2 배출량의 기록상의 차이를 줄이기 위해 회원국 주무 당국에 WLTP의 검증성 강화를 위한 감시권한부여, 인센티브로서 CO2 배출성능요건 완화율 조정 관련 방법론의 규정 내 추가, 간접토지용도변경을 통한 CO2 배출증가로 인한 CO2 배출성능요건에 대한 완화조정 고려, 그리고 유럽역내 디젤차량의 높은 선호도 등은 집행위원회의 이 규정 시행에 있어 심도 있게 제고해야하는 요인들로 보인다.
한국 정부도 자동차 CO2 배출량 규제에 있어 위반 회수를 반영한 엄중한 과징금 산정 방식을 적용해야 한다. 그리고 다른 한편으로는 CO2 배출량요건이상의 추가 감축을 한 승용차 제조업체에게 추가 감축량에 상응하는 배출량요건을 완화시키는 방향으로의 선회적인 접근도 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

현재까지 보존처리와 보수과정에서 조사된 대부분의 불상들은 조성 당시의 도금 이후 여러 차례 계속적으로 개금되었다. 따라서 전통적인 도금방식과 더불어 근대기 까지의 다양한 재료와 기법의 사용 흔적이 확인된다. 이를 통해 근대기의 도금기법은 물론 그 변화 과정도 알 수 있다. 1962년 카슈의 국내생산이 시작된 후 칠박도금의 접착제는 옻칠과 아교·어교 등에서 카슈로 전환되었다. 그리고 목공예와 자동차 도장에 사용되던 분무도장기법이 불상 도금에 응용되었다. 즉 불상 신체부위에 도금된 금분의 보호를 위한 래커 도포에서부터 시작하여 폴리우레탄수지 도료와 가금분을 혼합하여 도포하는 방법으로 변화한 것이다. 일부 불상에는 불신과 신체 전부를 모두 가금분으로 도포하는 방법을 사용하기도 한다. 이러한 신 재료의 적극적인 수용과 제작기법의 변화는 비용절감과 생산성을 향상시키게 되었으며 전혀 새로운 칠박도금 제작과정을 만들어냈다. 즉 칠박도금은 전통적인 눈메움층과 칠층 형성과정이 생략된 단순화되고 변형된 기법으로 변화하였으며, 제작 장인 또한 다양화되는 계기가 되었다. 이는 다양성과 합리성을 추구하는 근대라는 시대성에도 적합했던 것으로 이해된다.
다행히 일부 도금장인들에 의해 칠박도금은 전통적인 재료와 기법으로 원형에 가깝게 계승되고 있다. 전통 칠박도금의 계승과 변화에 관한 연구는 칠박도금의 역사성과 우수성 그리고 이에 대한 필요성과 가치를 확인해 나가는 작업이기 때문이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이를 위해 이 글에서는 우선 북선개척사업의 전개과정을 다루었다. 1931년 시작된 북선개척사업은 삼수, 갑산 등 함경남북도와 평안북도의 8개 군에 들어차 있던 삼림을 베어내고(삼림개발) 화전민을 정착시키며(화전민 지도) 이 과정에서 삼림의 보호를 도모하는 사업이었다. 삼림개발 즉, 벌목사업에 유리하도록 척식철도, 삼림철도, 궤도 등을 부설하는 것이 사업의 핵심이었다. 1930년대 중반이 되면 북선개척사업과 연동하여 척식철도로 惠山線(길주혜산진)과 白茂線(백암무산)이 구간별로 점점 개통되어 갔다. 1934년에는 성진혜산진 도로가 자동차가 다닐 수 있는 수준으로 개수가 완료되었다. 이로써 원래 압록강·두만강 수로로 이동하던 목재들은 철로를 따라 성진항에 도착하게 되었다. 또한 해당 철도와 도로 연변으로 풍부한 지하자원이 매장되어 있음이 확인되면서 이들에 대한 운반 수요 또한 상당한 상황이었다.
아울러 이 글에서는 북선개척사업의 영향으로 성진항에 貯木場 시설이 들어서고 해당 시설이 이후 성진 시가지계획 구상에 기반이 되었음을 설명하였다. 북선개척사업으로 인해 성진항은 목재를 비롯한 각종 자원이 呑吐하는 항만으로 중요성이 높아졌다. 밀려드는 목재를 수용할 목적으로 1933년부터 漢泉川 하구에 저목장 시설 및 철도 인입선, 호안공사 등 각종 부대공사가 진행되어 1935년 완공을 보았다. 1936년 공포된 성진 시가지계획 가로망의 핵심노선은 원산회령 1등 도로, 성진혜산진 2등 도로의 시가지 구간으로, 이 두 노선은 한천천 우안 한천교 근처에서 교차하여 저목장 시설로 연결되었다. 이 계획에 따라 이루어진 성진 시가도로의 개수 공사는 저목장 시설 인근 목재 회사들과 쌍포동 高周波제철공장 부지와도 긴밀하게 연결되었다. 저목장 공사와 연계하여 진행된 성진 시가지 북쪽 한천천 양안의 호안공사 또한 시가지계획 적용 직전 완료됨으로써, 이를 기반으로 마그네사이트공장이 들어선 연호동 일대(제2구)의 토지구획 정리 또한 진행될 수 있었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

하지만 양국관계는 20세기 내내 기대만큼 발전하지 못했다. 하지만 2008년 글로벌 재정위기를 계기로 중국과 브라질은 급속히 가까워져, 바로 이듬해인 2009년부터 서로의 최대 무역파트너가 되었다. 2018년의 경우, 브라질의 대 중국 수출액은 거의 470억 달러에 이르렀는데 그것은 미국에서 얻은 수입의 약 2배였다.
이와 동시에 중국의 대 브라질 투자 역시 증가했다. 중국은 최근 약 200억 달러를 브라질의 고부가가치 분야에 투자했는데, 본 연구의 목적은 그것의 원인을 밝히는 데에 있다. 우선 중국의 투자가 어느 시기 어떤 분야에 집중되었는지를 살펴본 이후, 그것의 원인을 브라질과 중국 측 요인으로 나누어 살펴보고자 했다. 본 논문의 관심 시기는 2013년 후반기부터 2018년 전반기까지인데, 그것은 2013년 후반기부터 브라질의 경기가 본격적으로 침체되기 시작했고, 2018년 10월 브라질의 대선기간 중, 강력한 반-중국 정서로 양국의 관계 변화가 불가피하다고 예측했기 때문이다. 그 중 가장 대표적인 인물이 당시 유력후보였던, 그리고 현재 브라질 대통령인 볼소나루(Bolsonaro)인데, 그는 “중국이 브라질에서 구매하는 것이 아니라, 브라질을 구매하고 있다”라고 신랄하게 비판하며, 미국과의 관계개선을 선언했다.
21세기 중국의 대 브라질 투자는 첫 번째 시기(2007-2010), 발전 잠재력이 무한한 농업, 축산업, 광업 등 원자재 분야에; 두 번째 시기(2011-2012), 전기·전자 및 자동차 등 내수시장을 겨냥한 제조업 분야에; 세 번째 시기(2013-2014), 금융 및 IT 등 서비스분야에; 그리고 네 번째 시기(2015-2018), 경기침체기에 접어들면서 에너지 등 인프라 구축 분야에 투자가 집중되었다.
결론적으로 본 연구는 2014년 시작된 시진핑의 ‘일대일로’(一帶一路, One Belt and One Road) 정책이 중국의 대 브라질 투자를 촉진시켜서 오늘날 약 200여개의 중국기업을 브라질에 진출시켰다는 것을 보여주려 했으며, 또한 2018년 중국 양회(兩會)의 결과가 그의 입지와 정책을 강화시켰다는 것을 강조하고자 했다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,지방세 이자상당액 가산제도 도입방안 = A study on the introduction of the interest addition system for local taxes,"local tax,equivalent amount of interest,national tax exemption restriction law,local tax exemption restriction law,exemption,지방세,이자상당액,조세특례제한법,지방세특례제한법,감면,추징","조세는 국가나 지방자치단체의 재정수입조달이 고유의 목적이지만, 경제정책이나 사회정책적 목적을 달성하기 위해 납세의무를 감면하고 있다. 그러나 납세자가 감면의 목적달성을 하지 않게 되면, 경감했던 납세의무를 다시 부담시키고 있다. 이렇게 당초의 감면목적을 달성하지 못하고 납세의무를 다시 이행하게 될 경우에 다른 납세자와 비교하면 감면받은 기간 동안에 이자상당액의 경제적 이익이 발생하게 된다. 국세의 경우에는 이자상당액 가산제도를 시행하고 있으나, 지방세는 개인지방소득세에서만 이자상당액 가산제도가 있다. 본 논문에서는 국세의 이자상당액 가산제도를 살펴보고 비교법적으로 취득세 등이 감면되었다가 추징되는 경우에 이자상당액을 가산하는 방안을 모색하는 것에 연구의 목적을 두고 있다.
이자상당 가산액은 국가나 지방자치단체가 정책목적을 위해 납세의무를 경감한 후에 납세자가 감면의 목적을 달성하지 아니함으로써 감면했던 세액을 추징하면서 본세에 부대하여 부과시키는 금전이라 할 수 있다. 이자상당 가산액은 감면이 없었다면 지방자치단체가 향유할 이익이지만, 감면으로 인해 납세자가 갖게 된 이익을 회수하는 것이므로 이익발생가능성이 있어야 한다(이익발생가능성). 세금을 감면할 때에 일정한 기간동안 특정 목적에 자산을 사용하거나 특정한 행위를 요구하고 있는 경우에는 그러한 것도 일종의 납세자에게 부여된 의무로서 납세자가 당초에 약속한 것을 성실하게 지키지 아니할 경우에는 그 감면처분에 따라 납세자가 받았던 경제적 이익은 모두 제거되어야 할 것이다(신의성실 위반). 이자상당 가산액은 원본 채권에 부대하여 가산하는 것이므로 당연히 본세가 추징되는 경우에만 가산할 수 있는 부대채권이라 할 것이다(부종성 원칙).
조세평등주의는 담세능력에 따라 공평하게 부담이 되어져야 하고 합리적인 이유 없이 특정인을 불리하게 대우하거나 우대하는 것은 허용할 수 없는 것을 말하는데, 국가의 다양한 정책적 목적으로 조세가 활용되고 있으므로 세금감면은 정책적 목적에 부합되게 운용이 되어져야 한다. 그러나 감면제도를 악용하는 경우에 결과적으로 경제적 이익을 얻게 되므로 이러한 조세형평상의 문제점을 해결하고, 감면제도가 당초의 목적대로 활용될 수 있도록 지방세 감면에도 이자상당액 가산제도의 도입이 필요하다.
적용대상 세목은 취득세와 재산세가 가능하다고 보며, 취득세의 경우 감면항목 190개 중에서 추징이 되는 것이 144개이고 추징이 되지 아니하는 것이 46개인데, 대부분 취득세를 감면하여 해당 사업을 경제적으로 지원하거나 특정산업을 육성시키는 등의 목적으로 활용되고 있다. 따라서 당초의 목적대로 사용하지 아니한 경우에는 신의성실의 원칙위반, 감면목적 미달성, 자산을 보유하고 있음으로써 이익발생 가능성이 있으므로 취득세 등을 추징하는 경우에 이자상당액을 가산하는 것이 타당하다. 예외적으로 장애인?국가유공자?다자녀가구 자동차 감면, 농업용 시설 및 자활용사촌 내 축사감면은 서민 등에 대한 감면이므로 이자상당액을 가산하지 않도록 하며, 이 경우 총 144개 추징항목 중에서 5개를 제외한 139개가 적용대상이다.
재산세 및 지역자원시설세는 매년 6월 1일 현재 해당 목적에 사용하는 경우에 감면을 하고, 그러하지 아니하면 감면을 하지 아니한다. 따라서 사후 추징조항 ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is widely known that the specification of a lubricant and its consumption in an ICE considerably influences the release of regulated harmful emissions under normal engine operating conditions.
Considering DPF clogging phenomena associated with lubricant-derived soot/ash components, a simulated aging mode is designed for DPF to facilitate engine dynamometer testing. A PM/ash accumulation cycle is developed by considering real-world engine operating conditions for the increment of engine oil consumption and natural DPF regeneration for ash accumulation. The test duration for DPF aging is approximately 300 h with high- and low-SAPs engine oils. Detailed engine lubricant properties of new and aged oils are analyzed to evaluate the effect of engine oil degradation on vehicle mileage. Furthermore, physical and chemical analyses are performed using X-CT, ICP, and TGA/DSC to quantify the engine oil contribution on the PM composition. This is achieved by sampling with various filters using specially designed PM sampling equipment. Using high SAPs engine oil causes more PM/ash accumulation compared with low SAPs engine oils and this could accelerate fouling of the EGR in the engine, which results in an increase in harmful exhaust gas emissions. These test results on engine lubricants under operating conditions will assist in the establishment of regulated and unregulated toxic emissions policies and lubricant quality standards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We constructed regression models that reflect the car ownership and changes of user’s behavior after carsharing in terms of private transportation, public transportation, taxi, and future vehicle ownership plan using ordered logit and binary logit models. The analysis results indicate that carsharing not only reduces the private car usage, but also the use of public transportation or taxis. Especially, the results show that carsharing reduces the use of public transportation significantly among the three types of transportation mode. This result indicates the conflicting relationship between carsharing and public transportation policy. On the other hand, this study shows that carsharing leads to active responses of carsharing users such as sale of vehicles, abandonment of vehicle purchasing plans, etc. This finding indicates that carsharing is more likely to play a positive role in reducing car use and car ownership in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Recognition of Driving and Parking Lines for Intelligent Vehicles Using Bird Eye View System,"Intelligent vehicle (지능형 자동차),Lane recognition (차선 인식),Top view (평면 시점),Auto parking (자동 주차)","In this paper, we propose a noble line-recognition algorithm of driving parking for intelligent vehicles by using images obtained from a bird’s eye view system. To achieve safe driving and parking of unmanned vehicles, we need to obtain noiseless and effective images around vehicles. In addition, fast image processing is a fundamental requirement for the real time recognition of lanes and obstacles to ensure safety. In fact, the number of sensors equipped with conventional unmanned vehicles is reluctant to their commercialization. To solve this problem, we propose a noble method to detect straight lines and turning curves in the images obtained from a bird’s eye view system. For conventional vehicles equipped with this bird’s eye view system, straight lines and turning curves are detected by using a Hough and trigonometric function. Since parking lines have the form of a rectangle or parallelogram, detection of their vertexs makes it possible to determinate parking areas. In the case of a parking space without parking lines, the parking space is detected by using a stereo algorithm after calculating the area for parking. The experimental results using the proposed algorithm show that, without additional sensors, the lines and the surrounding environment are detected for unmanned driving and auto-parking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, existing lane detection technology in Level 2 systems is based on a relatively ideal situation in which the lane is clear as the highway and the curvature is moderate. Therefore, it is difficult to apply and commercialize to complex lane environments such as large curvature roads or off-ramp roads. In this paper, we propose a lane detection algorithm using hough transform algorithm for straight lane detection and RANSAC(Random sample consensus) algorithm. First, the road image is preprocessed using the feature of the road rules of the lane, and then the second order curve fitting is performed by applying the algorithm. Then, in order to detect the correct driving lane in the environment such as off-ramp roads, the information of a global path like navigation information is used.

  현대법치국가의 임무는 국민의 자유와 권리의 보장·강화에 궁극목적이 있다. 법치국가에서의 법규는 그 의미와 내용을 명확히 하여, 수범자들에게는 예측가능하고 구체적인 행동규범으로, 집행자에게는 보편타당한 지침으로 작용하게 하여 공동체 구성원 모두에게 신뢰를 주는 법적 안정성을 확보하여야 한다.
  그런 연유에서 명확성원칙은 입법, 행정 및 사법의 국가활동에 있어서 하나의 필요적 의무로 구현되어야 한다. 즉 입법활동에 있어서는 법규의 조문으로 명확하고 구체적으로 고지되어야 하며, 법집행에 있어서는 자의성을 배제하고 객관적·구체적인 처분을 하도록 요구하며, 사법활동에 있어서는 모호하고 다의적으로 해석이 가능한 법규는 무효가 되어야 한다.결국 법규는 언어와 문자 및 도화 등 어떤 방법으로 표시되든 간에 그 규정은 일의적·구체적이고 명확한 것이어야 한다.
  따라서 헌법재판소의 위헌판단의 1차적 기준은 당연히 명확성의 원칙이 되어야 한다. 그러므로 입법목적의 정당한 기준에 의한 ‘좋은 법’이라 하드라도 규정방식 및 조문의 의미와 내용이 불명확하고 지나치게 추상적이라면, 평균인으로서의 수범자가 예측하기 힘들다면 다분히 위헌적 소지가 있다. 그러므로 법규나 처분이 아무리 목적의 정당성이 있다할 지라도 절차적(방법적) 정당성까지 포섭하지는 못한다. 그것이 바로 진정한 법치국가의 소명이며 정당성이다.
  본 연구에서는 교통사고 방지라는 목적을 달성하기 위하여 양적으로 증가하고 구간길이도 더 길어지는 무분별한 구간단속의 근거규정인 도로교통법 제17조와 그 위임법규들이 헌법의 명확성원칙(막연하기 때문에 무효인 이론)이나 포괄위임입법금지의 관점에서 위헌적 요소가 다분히 있을 수 있다고 여겨지므로, 향후의 관련법규의 제?개정과 과속단속활동을 시행함에 있어서 좀 더 신중을 기할 것을 제언하는 바이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rockefeller 3,JDR 3 Fund,Asian Cultural Program,Porter McCray,Asian Cultural Council","이 논문에서는 1963년 설립되어 자동차 사고로 인해 존 록펠러 3세(John D. Rockefeller 3rd)가 급작스런 죽음을 맞이한 1978년까지 지속한 록펠러 3세 기금(JDR 3rd Fund)을 중심으로 록펠러 재단이 한국미술계를 위해 펼친 지원사업의 양상과 특징에 대해 살펴본다. 록펠러 3세 기금은 미국과 아시아 사이에 시각예술과 공연예술 분야 문화교류 지원을 위해 1963년에 설립된 기구로서 록펠러 아카이브 센터에서 검색한 자료를 토대로 미술 분야에 한정해서 한국의 미술가와 학자가 수혜를 받은 사례를 살펴보면 회화/조각 분야에 김창열, 윤명로, 최만린, 김환기, 김차섭, 김병기, 박종배, 미술사 분야에 안휘준, 박물관학 분야에 김재원, 권이구, 손보기, 고고학 분야에 김원룡, 건축 분야에 강홍빈 등이 있다.
  록펠러 3세 기금이 동서문화 이해를 도모하기 위해 1963년에 시작한 아시아 문화프로그램 (Asian Cultural Program)은 1) 아시아인에게 기회를 제공하기 위해 아시아인이 미국과 때로 유럽 또는 아시아에서 훈련을 받고 예술활동을 시찰할 수 있도록 여행과 유학 장학금을 제공하고, 2) 아시아 문화전통의 검토와 보존을 고무하기 위해 아시아 박물관 인력이 등록, 목록작성, 사진 자료, 설치, 보존, 교육프로그램 같은 분야에서 박물관 훈련 쌓을 수 있도록 지원하며, 3) 아사아의 문화적 업적이 미국에서 전시, 공연되는 것을 촉진하기 위해 전시, 공연 투어, 강연-실연 투어, 레지던시 프로그램을 제공하고, 4) 아시아에서 미국의 문화적 업적의 전시와 공연을 촉진한다는 4가지 사업목표를 갖고 있었다.
  이 프로그램을 기획한 포터 맥크레이(Porter McCray)는 다양한 가치를 지니고 서로 다른 발전단계에 있는 나라들이 공존하는 상황에서 각 나라가 지닌 독특한 문화에 대한 상호존중과 교류가 필요하고 그것을 토대로 생산적인 문화 관계가 가능하다는 전제하에 아시아 문화프로그램의 운영을 위한 모델을 개발했다. 사업의 목표와 대상 지역 그리고 지원 분야를 고려할 때 록펠러 3세 기금의 프로그램은 1950년대 파스가 아시아에서 추진한 문화지원 활동이 고도화된 것이라 평가할 수 있다.
  1975년 아시아 문화프로그램 운영 12년간의 활동을 평가하기 위해 록펠러 3세 기금은 개인 수혜자들을 대상으로 기금의 지원이 수혜자의 개인적 발전과 경력 그리고 소속기관의 업무에 어떤 영향을 끼쳤는지에 대한 설문조사를 했다. 한국인 수혜자 총 55명 중 설문지를 작성하여 보낸 사람은 총 11명으로 추정되는데, 이 설문지 내용을 살펴보면 수혜자들이 록펠러 3세 기금의 지원 덕택에 한국의 박물관 제도가 정착되고 고고학과 미술교육 분야가 발전하게 되었다는 인식하고 있음을 확인할 수 있다. 그러나 많은 수혜자가 한국으로 귀국하지 않고 미국에 정착함으로써 록펠러 3세 기금의 애초 의도가 제대로 구현되지 못하는 한계도 찾아볼 수 있다. 1970년대에 록펠러 3세 기금은 문화교류의 정치, 경제적 가치를 중시하며 일방적으로 지원에서 방식에서 벗어나 상호교류를 강조하는 방식으로의 변화를 꾀한다. 그 과정에서 경제성장을 배경으로 등장한 한국문예진흥원이나 대우재단과 같은 한국 공 · 사립 문화재단은 상호교류의 주요한 파트너였다. 이러한 문화재단의 출현은 록펠러 재단이 아시아에서 펼친 문화사업의 의미 있는 성과로 평가할 수 있다. 록펠러 재단이 한국 공 · 사립 문화재단의 형성과 활동에 어떠한 영향을 주었는지는 1970년대 ACC의 사업에 대한 분석을 토대로 한 후속 연구를 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,환경법에서의 자유와 자율성 = 보다 적은 규제에 의한 보다 많은 환경보호?,"환경법,자유,자율성,규제,환경보호,Umweltrecht,Freiheit,Freiwilligkeit,Reglementierung,Umweltschutz","우리는 누구나 환경오염자이다. 우리는 자동차를 운행하고, 석유로 난방을 하며, 플라스틱용기로 요구르트를 먹고, 바지를 화학제품을 사용하여 세탁하고, 우리가 사용한 유연제에 의해 생선이 피해를 입고 있다. 그러나 우리가 모든 편리함을 그만두고, 가장 검소한 생활로 참고 살아도, 어떤 방법으로도 환경에 부담을 지우지 않고 살아가는 것은 절대 불가능하다. 우리는 환경이용자로 태어났다. 우리는 우리와 독립한 환경의 외측에 있는 것이 아니라, 우리 자신이 생태계의 일부이며, 그 작용구조나 생존관계에 연결되어 있다.
  그러므로 우리의 자유는 대부분 환경부담(부하, 하중)의 자유이다. 우리가 자유의 실현 가운데 행하는 것의 대부분이 어떠한 환경 침해적 작용을 하게 된다. 환경의 보호를 담당하는 법 규정은 환경부담의 자유를 제약하고, 이에 의해 필연적으로 자유 그 자체, 즉 기본법이 제2조 제1항에서 보장하고자 하는 각인이 희망하는 무언가를 행하거나 하지 않거나 하는 자유로서의 행위자유를 제약하고 있다. 환경을 실효적으로 보호하기 위해서는 당장 무한계로 구상된 행위자유에 대한 광범위한 제약이 불가결한 것은 의심의 여지가 없다.
  하지만 환경의 법적보호가 보다 포괄적 그리고 보다 완전한 형태로 형성되면 될수록, 점점 많은 행위영역도 점점 많은 사람이 환경법상의 자유의 제약을 받게 된다. 또한 법적으로 정해진 환경보호가 보다 철저하게 되면 될수록 환경이용자에 의한 자유제한은 보다 심각해 진다.
  환경의 이용은 인간 자신에게 있어도, 다른 생명체에 있어도, 생태학 상으로 필요사항이다. 환경이용이 유해하게 되는 것은 생태학 상의 상호관계가 밸런스를 잃게 될 때, 또는 재생 불가능한 리소스(자원)가 과잉으로 소비될 때이다. 하지만 여기에서 오늘날 우리의 현실적인 문제가 있다. 오늘날 우리를 위협하는 것은, 이론적으로만 생각할 수 있는 과도한 환경보호에 의한 인간의 생존기반의 박탈이 아니라, 오히려 과소한 환경보호에 의한 이 생존기반의 파괴이다. 전체주의적 환경보호 국가에 의한 자유의 부정이라고 하는 이론적 가능성이 오늘날 현실적인 문제가 아니라, 환경 황폐가 인간의 자유에도 미칠 수 있는 영향이 문제이다.
  그렇다면 환경보호를 보다 훌륭히 성취하기 위해서는, 더욱 국가의 규율이 필요한 것인가? 그렇지 않으면, 명령이나 금지규범의 완화에 의한 자유를 확대하고, 동시에 환경보호의 실효성을 높이는 것이 가능한가? 결론적으로 이 문제는 일반적으로 답변될 것이 아니라, 구체적으로 개개의 환경법규와 복잡하게 관련된 작용분석을 근거로 하여서만 가능할 것이다. 본고에서는 그러한 상세한 분석을 제시하고자 하는 것은 아니라, 제기된 문제에 암묵 가운데 포함된 가정, 즉 자유 제약적 규범의 폐지에 의해 자유가 확대된다고 하는 가정에 대해서 논하고자 한다.

단일차원의 자동차 브랜드 가치가 두 개의 속성차원으로 분해되었을 때 경제적 측면과 성능 측면으로 구분되는 것으로 확인되었다. 기존연구에서 속성차원을 해석하는 방식은 속성공간에 분포되어 있는 브랜드를 보고 속성차원을 주관적으로 해석했다면 본 연구에서는 회귀분석을 통해 보다 객관적인 해석이 가능하도록 했으며 설명변수의 유의성도 통계적으로 검정 가능해졌다.

The results show that the IDCB tracks the reference yaw rate under all tested conditions; in addition, it reduces the body slip angle and roll angle. When a vehicle runs on a split-μ road and a brake input is applied, the IDCB virtually eliminates the lateral dynamics. Thus, the IDCB improves the lateral stability, preserves the steerability and enhances the ride comfort of vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since decades, the R12 refrigerant is not used in automobile air-conditioners because of the ozone depletion potential (ODP) problem, and for the last 20 years, the ODP-free R134a refrigerant is leading the new automotive air-conditioning market. However, owing to its high global warming potential (GWP), the R134a refrigerant use in automobile air-conditioning system is also prohibited by law, and alternative refrigerants with a low GWP need to be proposed. Therefore, recently, the application of R1234yf, R152a, or other alternative refrigerants has started worldwide. By contrast, natural refrigerant R744 was introduced in the market several years ago by VDA (Verband Der Automobilindustrie), which is a German association in the automotive industry. This study also deals with refrigerant oils.
For a long time, polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil has been traditionally used with automobile air-conditioners, and polyolester (POE) oil is suitable for HEV, PHEV, and EV air-conditioning systems, where it is used by the electrically driven compressor owing to its excellent electrical insulation properties.

CL은 수분을 흡수하는 성질이 있어 보관 조건에 따라 수분 함량이 쉽게 증가한다. 하지만 PA6합성시 수분이 존재할 경우 CL보다 활성제의 사슬 말단과 빠르게 반응하여 고분자의 성장을 방해하고 중합반응을 종결 시킨다. 따라서 음이온 개환중합을 진행하기 위해선 CL의 수분제어는 필수적이다. 본 연구에서는 보관 조건에 따른 수분 함량의 변화를 확인하고 음이온중합을 위한 수분함량 적정 기준을 제시하였다. 또한 CL의 수분제거 공정을 설계하고 연구하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  완샹그룹, 웨이차이, 쥔셩전자, 닝보화샹전자, 완펑아오터 등 5개 주요 부품회사의 해외 M&A 사례를 분석한 결과 완샹의 경우 해외 M&A 이후 중국에 합작회사를 설립하였고 배터리 관련 특허를 대량으로 출원하여 해외 기술 습득과 기술혁신의 성과를 보여주었다. 이에 비해 나머지 4개 회사는 피인수기업과의 공동 또는 독자적인 기술 개발의 증거를 찾지 못하였다. M&A를 통해 선진 기술을 도입하고 첨단 제품을 생산하게 되었을지는 모르지만 그 기술을 내부화시켰다고 볼 수는 없었다.
  중국 정부의 부품산업 정책은 대형화를 통한 경쟁력 제고이다. 큰 기업이 양질의 기술을 개발할 수 있다는 논리인데, 중국 기업들의 특허를 분석해 보니 소수 기업에 특허가 너무 집중되어 있었다. 기술혁신의 성과가 극소수 기업에게만 집중된다면 전체 부품산업의 발전에는 부정적 영향을 줄 가능성이 크다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

사람이 해서 무죄가 되는 행위라면, 자율주행차가 그렇게 움직이도록 명령을 입력한 사람도 무죄가 되어야 한다. 자율주행차가 선회를 하든 직진을 하든 그렇게 알고리즘을 짠 제조사는 기대불가능성의 이론을 주장하여 무죄가 나오도록 법원을 설득해야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

세계 각국에서 기존의 자동차 업체들 뿐 아니라 구글이나 애플과 같은 IT기업들도 개발을 위해 최선을 다하고 있으며, 각 국가들도 엄청난 지원을 하고 있다. 그런 상황에서 관련 법연구 및 법제에 있어 한 걸음 앞서 나가고 있는 독일의 상황이 한국에 주는시사점이 작지 않을 것이다. 그래서 본 연구는 인공지능 및 자율주행자동차와 관련해서 독일의 여러 법분야의 논의 내용과 한국의 법분야의 논의 내용을 비교분석하여 한국의 법분야 논의 지평을 넓힐 수 있는 시사점을 도출하는 것을 목적으로 삼았다. 그를 위해 한국의 관련 연구상황을 개관해 보고, 독일의 사법분야, 공법분야, 도로교통법분야, 정보보호 및 개인정보법분야 등으로 구분하여 논의내용을 살펴보았다.
결과적으로 한국의 법 분야에서는 아직까지 각론 보다는 총론적인 연구들이 많고, 정책연구의 정도가 아직도 추상성이 높아 구체적으로 입법으로 연결되지 않고 있으며, 학제 간 융합연구보다는 학문 내 연구로 진행되는 경우가 많기 때문에 논의의 범위가 다소 제한된다. 물론 최근에는 4차 산업 융합학회나 인공지능 학회 등 다양한학회들이 창설되어 보다 많은 연구들이 진행되고 있고, 이 분야에 대한 관심을 가진연구자들도 많아지고 있기 때문에 보다 많은 연구성과들이 나올 것으로 예상된다.
문제는 연구결과들이 국가정책과 입법으로 연결되는 경우가 많지 않다는 것이다. 독일과 한국의 가장 큰 차이는 독일의 경우 연구와 입법 및 정치가 밀접하게 연결되어있기 때문에 선순환 관계를 나타내고 있는 반면, 한국은 별개로 작동한다는 것이다.
따라서 국가는 인공지능 및 자율주행자동차와 관련된 우수한 연구성과들이 입법이나 사법, 행정정책에 반영될 수 있도록 보다 적극적인 자세를 취할 필요가 있다. 그리고 학자들도 좀 더 구체적이고 현실적인 연구를 통해 국가에서 필요로 하는 이론을구축할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

YOLO의 컨볼루션 네트워크는 전체 이미지에서 한 번의 평가를 통해서 직접적으로 경계박스들을 예측하고 각 클래스의 확률을 계산하고 물체 탐지 과정이 단일 네트워크이기 때문에 탐지 성능이 최적화 되며 빠르다는 장점을 가지고 있다. 기존의 슬라이딩 윈도우 접근법과 R-CNN 계열의 탐지 방법은 region proposal 방법을 사용하여 이미지 안에 가능성이 많은 경계박스를 생성하고 각 요소들을 따로 학습하기 때문에 최적화 및 실시간 적용에 어려움을 가지고 있다. 제안하는 연구는 YOLOv2 알고리즘을 적용하여 기존의 알고리즘이 가지고 있는 물체 탐지의 실시간 처리 문제점을 해결하여 실시간으로 지상에 있는 자동차를 탐지하는 방법을 제안한다. 제안하는 연구 방법의 실험을 위하여 오픈소스로 제공되는 Darknet을 사용하였으며 GTX-1080ti 4개를 탑재한 Deep learning 서버를 이용하여 실험하였다. 실험결과 YOLO를 활용한 자동차 탐지 방법은 기존의 알고리즘 보다 물체탐지에 대한 오버헤드를 감소 할 수 있었으며 실시간으로 지상에 존재하는 자동차를 탐지할 수 있었다.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이러한 연구목적을 가지고 실시된 분석 결과 부산의 부품산업은 지역 내부적 생산은 비효율적이지만 규모면에서 유리한 상황으로, 효율성을 제고하기 위해 규모이외 기술적 측면의 개선에 많은 노력이 있어야 할 것으로 분석되었다. 그리고 2008년 미국발 금융위기에 기술효율성 악화의 주요인이 순수기술효율성이었으나 2012년 유럽재정위기 당시에는 규모효율성 변화지수 하락의 영향이 큰 것을 확인할 수 있다. 그리고 2013-2014년에는 재정위기 장기화로 신기술 도입을 위한 투자가 크게 축소되어 생산성 증가의 동력이 크게 약화되었음을 볼 수 있다. 2005년부터 2016년에 걸친 시도별 맘퀴스트 지수의 평균 계측치에 따르면 부산을 포함한 서울, 대전, 충남, 경북, 경기의 경우 기술효율성은 퇴보하였으나 프론티어 기술변화가 진보하여 총생산성이 증가한 것으로 확인되었다. 결국 국내 자동차부품산업이 당면한 공통과제는 기업내부의 구조조정과 경영합리화 등을 통한 추격잠재력 효과 극대화라고 볼 수 있으며, 이를 통한 학습과 지식의 파급효과 극대화와 비용구조의 개선 등이 실현된다면 자동차부품산업의 총생산 개선효과는 극대화될 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  현재 타 지자체에서도 배출가스 등급제에 따라 차량 운행제한 방식을 적극 도입하고 있고, 그 기준을 강화해 나갈 예정에 있어 경남도에서도 이 방법론을 고려할 필요가 있음
  운행제한 방안
  공공기관: 5부제 상시화 및 비상저감조치 발령 시 2부제 시행(현행)
  시민: 비상저감조치 발령 시 배출가스 5등급 차량 운행 제한
  주요 기관 및 기업 밀집 지역은 기업체의 차량 2부제 참여 확대(통근버스 확대운영, 기업체 내 카풀제 운영 등)
  경남 지역 주요 시·군 대중교통 무료 이용방안을 수립
  배출가스 5등급 차량의 적발로 발생한 범칙금을 대중교통 무료 이용을 위한 지원금(보조금)으로 전환을 고려함
  비상저감조치의 단계별(그룹별) 적용 및 확대를 제안함
  도민 설문 종합
  경남도민은 미세먼지에 적극적으로 대처하기를 원하며, 차량 운행제한 방법이 도입된다면 참여하겠다고 밝히고 있음, 경남도는 이러한 여론을 감안하여 차량 운행제한에 대한 기준을 마련하고 도민들에게 홍보할 필요가 있음
  더불어 향후 4등급 차량으로 규제를 강화하는 것에 대해서도 찬성 비중이 높으므로, 경남도에서는 차량 운행제한의 수준을 장기적으로 수도권 수준으로 높이는 것을 고려한 필요가 있음",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

사례 비교 분석 결과 두 가지 유의미한 발견을 할 수 있었다. 첫째, 3개 지회 모두 상급단체와의 유기적인 조율이 조직화 과정에서 중요한 역할을 하였는데, 이는 노동조합의 역량 강화를 위해서는 기업별 노조체제보다는 산별 노조체제가 강점을 지니고 있음을 시사한다. 둘째, 3개 지회의 조직화 양상에서 차이가 있었는데, 이러한 차이는 기업 특성에서 비롯되었다. 파편화된 고용관계와 사용자의 노조 회피적인 대응은 조직화 과정을 전투적이면서 더디게 만들었던 반면, 직접적인 고용관계와 사용자의 온건한 대응은 조직화 과정을 협의적이면서 빠르게 만들었다. 이를 통해 도출할 수 있는 함의는 한국에서의 노조 조직화의 전망은 한편으로는 실질적인 산별노조로의 발전이 있어야 하며, 다른 한편으로는 사용자의 대응에 상응하여 한정된 자원을 효과적으로 활용할 수 있는 노조의 역량 제고에 달려 있다고 할 수 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But despite the importance and growth potential of IIoT, interest in IIoT is relatively low. The purpose of this study is to present policies for promotion that can ensure the substantial leap of Seoul’s IIoT industry and market. Considering the results of this study, SMG should contemplate the following policy directions. First, it is necessary to develop a policy with the commercialization of the actors participating in new IIoT product/service development in mind. Second, consider creating value between and within industries through the IIoT. Third, consider redefining roles and values of process, data etc. Fourth, it is necessary to consider support policies for the entire life cycle of commercialization from the business selection to the final after sales service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,인공지능 기반 자동행정과 법치주의 = Automatic Administration based on AI and rule of law,"인공지능,자동행정,법치주의,국가배상,인공지능 알고리즘,Artificial intelligence,Automatic Administration,Rule of law,National compensation,AI Algorithm","행정은 헌법적 가치의 실현이라는 본연의 목적에 충실하기 위해 다양한 기술을 통해 행정의 효율성과 합리성, 민주성을 제고해 왔다. 최근 정보통신 기술과 인공지능 기술이 서로 접목되면서 우리사회는 산업혁명, 정보혁명을 넘어 이제 지능정보기술에 기반해 인간과 사물의 인지?사고 능력을 강화시키는 지능혁명을 맞이하고 있다. 이러한 변화는 최근 종종 4차산업혁명으로 총칭되기도 한다.
인공지능을 활용한 새로운 정보기술은 엔터테인먼트, 의료, 금융, 주식투자, 자동차 운전, 건축 설계, 우주항공 등 사회전반에서 인공지능을 통하여 처리할 수 있는 영역을 확대하고 있다.
4차산업혁명을 견인하는 대표적인 기술로 주목받고 있는 인공지능기술은 민간의 영역은 물론 치안, 교통관리, 재난대응, 안전관리 등 다양한 행정의 영역에서 그 활용가능성이 주목받고 있다. 아직은 기술적인 수준이 기존 전자적 행정과 본질적으로 다르지 않는 현실적 한계를 가지고 있지만, 인공지능기술이 규제행정에 있어 합리성과 효율성을 제고하는데 크게 기여할 수 있을 것이라는 기대는 향후 공행정 분야에 있어 인공지능기술의 활용 범위를 확대시켜 나갈 것으로 예상된다.
그러나 기존 업무에 대한 인공지능의 기술적 대체가능성, 비용 및 편익 등과 같은 현실적인 기준이 중요한 일반 민간분야와 달리 행정의 책임성과 공공성을 본질적 요소로 하는 공공분야에서는 과연 행정작용에 있어 인공지능을 활용할 수 있는가에 대해서는 다른 측면의 검토가 필요하다. 특히, 인공지능기술에 따라 산출된 자동적 행정결정의 경우에는 기존의 단순한 행정자동결정(예: 과속단속카메라에 의한 과속단속, 컴퓨터추첨에 따른 학교배정 등)과 달리 알고리즘의 복잡성, 결과예측곤란성 등으로 인해 전통적인 행정법이론의 적용에 적지 않은 논란을 야기할 것으로 예상된다. 즉, 행정작용이 인공지능시스템을 활용해 자동적으로 이루어지는 행정(이하 ‘인공지능 기반 자동행정’이라 한다)의 경우, 그에 따라 산출된 행정작용의 법적 성질, 재량행위의 영역에서의 제한성, 법치주의 관점에서의 수용성과 합법성 조건 등에 관한 법이론적 검토가 요구된다. 아울러 인공지능기반 자동행정에 의해 국민이 손해를 입은 경우 현행 국가배상법의 규정과 법리를 고려할 때 구제상 장애는 없는지도 살펴야 할 것이다.
이에 아래에서는 인공지능의 기술적 특성과 활용 현황을 살펴보고, 인공지능기술이 공행정의 영역에서 가지는 가능성과 한계는 무엇이며, 행정에 있어서 인공지능기술 활용시 담보되어야 할 합헌성?합법성 요소는 무엇인지에 대해 논한다. 비록 현재 인공지능 기반 행정 사례의 현실적인 제한성으로 말미암아 불가피하게 일정한 가정과 추상성을 토대로 분석하는 한계를 지닐 것이나 인공지능기술을 공행정 분야에 활용하는데 최소한의 공법적 기준을 제시하고, 향후 법이론적 발전의 단초를 제공하는 시론적 고찰의 의미를 가질 것으로 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  ? CPTPP는 전 세계 GDP의 13.5%와 세계 무역의 15%를 차지하고 있고, 가장 최신의 무역규범을 반영한 메가 FTA로서 의의가 있음.
  ? 우리 정부는 CPTPP 가입과 관련하여 수출시장 확대, 글로벌 생산네트워크 구축, 장기적 경제혁신 모멘텀 조성 등의 긍정적 효과에도 불구하고,
  ? 자동차 등 주요 제조업 분야에서 對일본 경쟁열위, 농산물 시장의 추가개방, 후발국으로서의 가입비용 등을 신중하게 검토해야 하는 입장임.
  우리나라가 CPTPP 9개 회원국과 체결한 FTA의 농식품시장 자유화율은 평균 78.4%로 CPTPP 회원국 평균 관세철폐율(96.3%)보다 낮지만, 일본의 CPTPP 관세철폐율(76.2%)보다는 다소 높음.
  ? 對CPTPP 회원국 농식품 수입 및 수출 비중은 25.0%(77억 달러)와 32.8%(21억 달러)이며,
  ? 주요 수입품목은 쇠고기(호주, 뉴질랜드), 돼지고기(캐나다, 칠레), 밀, 보리(호주, 캐나다), 치즈(뉴질랜드), 포도(칠레), 키위(뉴질랜드), 커피(베트남) 등으로 기체결 FTA로 인해 관세가 단계적으로 인하되고 있거나 철폐된 상황임.
  ? 수출시장은 일본, 베트남, 호주 순으로 규모가 크며, 담배, 라면, 혼합조제식료품, 기타곡물 발효주, 파프리카, 딸기 등을 주로 수출하고 있음.
  CPTPP 가입 상황을 대비하여 농산물 순수입국이자 우리와 농업여건이 유사한 일본의 협상전략과 민감품목 양허유형(관세 부분감축, TRQ 제공 및 현행관세 유지, 특정국 양허)을 참조하여 FTA 기체결국으로부터 농축산물의 추가적인 개방에 따른 파급영향을 최소화하는 양허안을 준비해야 함.
  ? 그동안 15개의 FTA 발효에 따른 시장개방 확대로, 다수의 농축산물이 공급과잉에 직면하기 쉬운 상태인 점을 고려하여, ‘TRQ 증량’보다는 ‘관세 부분감축’을 민감품목의 기본적인 양허방향으로 삼아 무역창출보다는 무역전환 효과를 유도해야 함.
  ? 한편, 과거와 달리 일본에 비해 우리나라 농산물의 가격경쟁력이 상당 부분 상실된 상태이며, 일본의 고품질 과일, 축산물과 유제품 등의 수입이 증가할 우려가 있기 때문에, 일본에 대한 농식품 양허는 신중하게 접근할 필요
  CPTPP 가입 시 WTO 규정 및 기체결 FTA 규범보다 강화된 CPTPP 규범(SPS, 수출보조, 국영기업 등)을 그대로 수용해야 하기 때문에, 농업부문에 미치는 부정적인 영향이 심화될 수 있음.
  ? 특히, 병해충과 가축질병의 지역화 및 구획화 인정, 상대국 SPS 조치의 동등성 인정, 기술적 협의 기한을 180일로 한정 등 대폭 강화된 SPS 규정은 수입국의 권한을 제한하기 때문에, 주요 신선 농축산물에 적용되고 있는 기존의 SPS 조치와 관련된 통상마찰이 증가하고, 불리할 경우 해당 조치의 해체로 귀결될 수 있음.

  산업화가 늦었던 우리나라에서는 1980년대 이후에 네오포드주의 혹은 네오테일러주의가 완성되었다. 이러한 테일러주의의 전개 과정은 자동화의 진전과 함께 노동자 숙련의 해체를 가져오는 것이었다. 자동차 산업 등에서 숙련을 중심에 두는 일본식 생산방식을 구축해 보려는 노력이 시도되었지만 대부분 실패하였다. 우리나라에서 숙련 배제 등 노동력의 활용을 최소화하려는 기술중심적 합리화였던 자동화는 주로 대기업에서 나타난 것이며, 중소기업의 경우는 숙련공이 부족하여 자동화를 도입하는 경우가 많았다.
  스마트 공장을 확산시키려는 정부의 노력은 스마트화의 본질에 대한 성찰적 반성을 필요로 한다. 미국에서의 연구에서는 AI 기반의 자동화가 사람이 잘하는 영역에 초점이 맞추어져 있어, 스마트화가 큰 생산성 시현으로 귀결되지 않는 것이 보고되고 있다. AI 기반의 자동화인 스마트화가 생산성의 증가없이 고용만을 대체하는 별 효과없는 자동화로 끝나지 않도록 정책적 개입이 필요하다. 정부는 고용의 사회적 가치를 극대화하는 방향으로, 즉 AI 등 자동화 기술이 인간의 노동을 더욱 고도화하는 방식으로 전개되도록 스마트 공장 정책을 수립해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  Pangyo Techno Valley is a set of representative innovation clusters in Gyeonggi-Do that pursues global advanced technology. Pangyo 1st Techno Valley is a cluster of convergence technologies such as IT, CT, and BT, which was initially planned and promoted by Gyeonggi-Do since 2005. Pangyo 2nd Techno Valley is another major innovation technology cluster of the 4th industrial revolution which is being developed by Gyeonggi-Do and central government since 2015.
  The innovation platform can be classified into three types according to the business model, and Pangyo Techno Valley can be regarded as ""Mediator Type"".
  The present study suggests platform strategies for Pangyo Techno Valley cluster in four aspects: demand, supply, platform service, governance. First, in terms of demand, it is necessary to attract early startups in the beginning stage of the cluster, and in the future, it should attract overseas startups and global startups. In terms of supply side, it is necessary to attract successful companies, investors and business service companies, and R&D projects. In terms of platform services, public agencies should initially provide business services and startup consulting, etc but gradually encourage the market to provide those services. Finally, in terms of governance, it is desirable to establish an integrated management organization for Pangyo Techno Valley in the near future.
  The present study also suggests platform strategies for the Autonomous Driving Control Center in Pangyo 2nd Techno Valley. The platform strategy for the Center can be presented as two alternatives according to the center`s operational objective. The first alternative is to set the objective as an ""Autonomous vehicle test bed"", and the second one is as a ""Smart mobility test bed"".
  Finally, we suggest several ways for promoting and marketing the Pangyo Techno Valley for globalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MaxEnt를 이용하여 오대산국립공원에서 뱀류 로드킬 분포를 예측한 평가모형의 설명력을 분석한 결과, 생성된 모델의 경우 AUC 값이 0.94로 신뢰성이 높은 것으로 나타났다. 오대산국립공원에서 로 드킬 발생 가능성은 고도 650m 부근에서 경사는 완만할수록 높아지는 것으로 나타났다. 또한, 북동 향(70°)을 가진, 수계와의 거리는 25m 이내이며, 주변 토지이용은 나지 부근이고, 좌?우 가장자리 환 경 특성은 산림과 수계인 도로에서 높아지는 것으로 나타났다. 전체 발생종의 주요 예측지점으로 도 출된 지역으로는 국도 6호선은 공원 남쪽 경계로부터 약 2.2㎞ 지역과 약 11.7㎞ 지역이었으며, 지방 도 446호선은 공원 남쪽 경계로부터 약 3.44㎞ 지역이었다. 국내 뱀류 로드킬 저감을 위한 로드킬 자료의 수집 및 분석은 국외에서 다양한 수준의 연구들이 수 행되고 있음을 고려해 볼 때, 연구 분야 및 실용 연구, 정책 개발, 시민과학자 활용 등 뱀류에 대한 로드킬 연구를 더욱 확대할 필요가 있다고 사료된다. 보다 효과적인 저감 시설물 설치를 위해서는 해 당 지역의 조건에 따라 터널형 생태통로와 유도울타리 등 다양한 유형의 시설물을 조합하여야 할 것 으로 판단된다. 국립공원내 뱀류 로드킬 저감을 위해서는 기존 도로를 대상으로 차량 속도를 저감할 수 있도록 과속방지턱 등의 다양한 저감시설이 필요하다. 기 설치된 울타리는 하단부에 높이 최소 40cm 이상으로 규격 1cm×1cm 이내의 망목을 덧대어 설치하는 것이 필요하다. 또한, 뱀류 로드킬 저감을 위한 다양한 자원봉사 프로그램을 마련한다면 국립공원내 뱀류 로드킬 저감을 위한 효과적인 방안이 될 수 있을 것으로 판단된다. 특히, 오대산국립공원 로드킬 예측 모델링에서 제시된 주요 발 생지점에 대해서는 뱀류의 도로 유입을 방지할 수 있도록 지점 특성에 맞는 충분한 길이와 높이 (40cm 이상), 망목 규격(1cm×1cm 이하)을 갖춘 유도울타리와 함께 터널형 생태통로 조성이 필요하 다. 조성 후 효과성 검증을 위한 사후 모니터링이 필요할 것으로 사료된다. 그 결과를 바탕으로 로드 킬 예측 모델링 연구를 타 공원으로도 확대 수행하여 공원관리에 반영하는 것이 필요하다. 국내 뱀류 로드킬 대응을 위한 전략은 현재「동물 찻길 사고(로드킬) 조사 및 관리 지침」조사대상에서 제외되어 있는 파충류가 조사대상에 반드시 포함되어야 할 것이다. 또한, 포유류 위주로 설치되어 있는 생태통 로를 뱀류가 생태계 안정성에 기여하는 특성을 고려하여 뱀류를 대상으로 한 생태통로의 확충이 필요 하다. 아울러, 신규 도로 건설시에는 계획 단계에서부터 관련 부서가 참여하여 충분한 사전조사와 효 용성 있는 저감 시설물 설치, 사후 모니터링을 위한 보완 조치가 가능토록 관련 법규정을 개정하는 것이 필요하다고 사료된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,모바일 방송 기술과 미래 융합 서비스,,"1990년대말, 한국은 북미 ATSC 방송표준을 사용하여, 세계 최초 HD Digital TV 방송시대를 시작하였고, 이동방송을 위해서는 DMB를 이용한 모바일 방송을 상용화하여, 이는 디지털 방송미디어 산업의 발전과 함께 글로벌 기술 경쟁력을 만드는 계기가 되었다.
이후, 20여년이 지난 최근, 한국은 북미 최신 방송표준기술인 ATSC3.0을 세계 최초로 국내에 상용화하여 4K UHD 지상파 방송시대를 여는 성과를 또다시 이루었다. 하지만, 그동안 통신기술의 눈부신 발달로 고해상도 몰입형 컨텐츠의 IP 스트리밍 서비스가 대중화되었고, 이에 따른 젊은 소비자들을 중심으로 미디어 소비 성향 변화가 확산되어, 이제는 새로운 형태의 미래 융합 방송미디어 서비스를 위한 기술과 정책이 요구되고 있다. 이에, 정부는 관련 산학연 전문가들과 2027년 ATSC3.0 UHD로의 모든 전환 정책을 위해서 다양한 요구사항을 고려한, 미래형 모바일 방송을 포함한 UHD 활성화 방안을 논의하고 있다.
미래형 모바일 방송은 스마트폰뿐만 아니라, 자동차와 사이니지, 홈 TV에서도 서비스 영역이 확장되어야 하며, IP와 연동하여 인터렉티브 양방향 서비스가 가능하여야 하고, 오디오, 비디오 엔터테인먼트뿐만 아니라 인터넷 데이터와 공공, 관심 정보의 데이터 캐스팅 서비스까지 가능하여야 한다. 본 고에서는 미래형 모바일 방송을 위하여, 현재 상용 서비스가 가능한 최신의 방송과 통신기술인 ATSC3.0과 5G를 통한 방송의 서비스와 기술에 대하여 살펴보고, 이들의 미래 융합 서비스의 가능성에 대하여 생각해 보는 기회를 삼고자 한다.
본 고의 구성은 서론에서는 방송미디어의 서비스 트렌드를 분석하여 모바일 방송의 복합적 요구사항을 도출해 보고, 본론에서는 현재, 한국의 지상파 UHD 방송표준 기술인 ATSC3.0의 이동방송으로서의 특성을 살펴보고, DMB 기술과 비교해 본다. 또한, 전세계적으로 관심과 실험이 시작되고 있는 5G 방송에 대해서도 그 내용과 동향을 살펴보았다. 그리고, 결론으로는 미래의 융합서비스에 대한 예측과 연구 사항에 대하여 생각해 본다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,고령자 주거환경 실내디자인 기준에 관한 연구,"Aging(고령화),Elderly(고령자),Elderly housing(노인주거),Design guidelines(설계기준),Aging in Place(거주 연속성)","경제적 수준과 삶의 질이 향상될수록 생활환경에 대한 기대치가 높아진다. 특히 생활의 기반이 되는 주거공간의 경우 다양한 주거욕구와 사회적 여건 변화에 따라 더 나은 환경을 실현하기 위해 노력하지만 한편으로는 나이가 들면서 사회적 위치의 상실과 자녀의 분가 등으로 사회적 접촉 기회가 줄어들고 신체적 운동성 약화로 인해 활동공간이 제약받고 있는 고령자가 대부분의 시간을 보내는 주거는 안전하고 생활이 편리한 공간이 되어야 한다.
  이에 따라 세계보건기구를 비롯한 각 국에서 고령자를 위한 다양한 가이드라인을 제공하고 있으며 우리나라에서도 건설교통부가 마련한 ‘노인가구 주택개조기준’은 고령자의 인체 치수 등을 고려하여 물리적 환경에 대한 기준을 설정하였다. 욕실의 안전사고 등을 방지하기 위한 손잡이 등은 자동차의 안전벨트와 같이 고령자가 안심하고 생활하기 위해 필요한 편의 시설임에도 불구하고 스스로 자신의 노화를 인정하는 것으로 인식되어 일반적인 주택에서 반영된 사례가 적다. 생활에 불편한 공간을 개선하는 대신 적응을 하고 돌봄이 필요한 상태가 되어서야 요양시설을 찾게 된다. 물리적 특성을 고려한다면 요양시설이 고령자의 안전성면에서는 우수하지만 자신의 추억과 생활범위를 유지하고자 하는 ‘거주 연속성(Aging in Place)’에 대한 요구와 급격히 증가하는 고령자 인구수를 고려한다면 고령자 스스로 자신에게 적합한 주거환경을 디자인하는 노력이 필요하다.
  고령화 사회에서 고령자에 대한 관심과 서비스는 모든 사람들이 함께 안전하고 쾌적하게 살 수 있는 공간을 만드는 것을 목표로 하며 그 사회를 구성하는 기본 단위인 주거공간을 고령자에게 적합하게 디자인하는 것은 고령자 삶을 건강하게 유지하게 하는 것과 함께 부양 인력의 감소와 의료 서비스 제공에 따른 사회적 비용을 절감할 수 있다.
  새롭게 주거환경을 만드는 경우 전 연령을 대상으로 유니버설디자인을 적용해야하지만 현재 고령자가 살고 있는 주택은 대부분 거주기간이 오래되어 개선할 부분이 많기 때문에 주거환경 전체를 개선하는 대신 고령자에게 필요한 편의시설을 선별적으로 적용하는 디자인이 필요하다. 디자인 과정에서 고령자를 비롯한 가족과의 대화는 디자이너가 인지하지 못하는 부분까지 세심한 검토가 가능하도록 하며 이에 따라 거주자의 만족도가 높아지게 된다. 본 연구에서는 경제적 제약으로 인해 거주공간의 불편함을 감수하면서 위험에 노출되어 있는 고령자들에게 편안한 공간을 디자인하는 과정과 아이디어를 살펴보고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  한편, 미국은 중국에 뒤이은 세계 2위의 온실가스 배출국으로서 미국의 기후변화정책 및 그 법제는 국제적인 기후변화정책 및 그 성공 여부에도 중요한 영향을 미친다고 할 수 있다.
  우선, 미국에서는 온실가스 배출규제와 관련하여 기후변화대책을 위한 신법의 정비의 어려움 등을 이유로 하여 기존의 대기오염을 규제하는 법률인 대기청정법을 사용하여 온실가스 배출규제를 행하는 접근법을 채용하고 있다. 이와 같이 대기청정법을 사용한 온실가스 배출규제라는 방침이 구체화한 전기가 되었던 것은 2007년 미국 연방대법원의 Massachusetts v. EPA 판결이다. 이 판결에 의하여 2009년 EPA는 온실가스의 「위험성 인정」을 하였으며, 그 결과 온실가스는 대기오염물질로서 인정되고 이른바 「배기관규칙」에 의해서 이동배출원인 자동차에 대한 온실가스 배출규제를 하게 되었다.
  게다가 EPA는 1977년의 대기청정법의 개정 이래 이동배출원규제의 대상이 되는 대기오염물질이 자동적으로 고정배출원규제의 대상으로도 된다는 입장을 채용하여 왔다. 이에 따라 EPA는 2010년 4월 고정배출원에 대해서도 대기청정법에 근거한 온실가스의 규제대상으로 하는 「유발규칙」을 공표하는 한편, 동년 6월에는 대기청정법의 배출기준치를 온실가스에 관해서는 완화한다는 내용의 「조정규칙」을 공표하였다. 그러나 이와같은 EPA의 유발규칙 및 조정규칙은 그 위법성이 다투어지게 되었다.
  이에 2014년 6월 미국 연방대법원의 Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA 판결의 다수의견은 ①PSD 프로그램 적용의 트리거인 「어떤 대기오염물질」에 온실가스가 포함된다는 해석은 허용할 수 없고, 온실가스의 배출을 이유로 고정배출원에 PSD프로그램의 허가를 요한다고 하는 EPA의 규칙은 제정법상의 권한을 일탈하고 있어 무효이지만, ②BACT가 요구되는 「규제에 따르는 오염물질」에 온실가스도 포함시켜 anyway sources로부터 배출되는 온실가스에 관하여 BACT를 요구하는 해석은 허용할 수 있다고 판시하였다.
  요컨대, 기후변화문제의 시급성과 중요성에도 불구하고 미국의 기후변화정책은 정권의 교체에 따라 부침을 거듭하고 있다. 경제 내지 산업우선정책을 추진하고 있는 트럼프행정부 하에서는 적극적인 기후변화정책 및 그 법제는 현재로서는 요원한 것으로 보인다. 미국의 기후변화정책, 나아가서는 국제사회 전체의 기후변화에의 대응은 대기청정법의 실질규정에 있어서의 「대기오염물질」의 해석에 관한 미국 연방대법원의 판결에 의해 좌우된다고도 할 수 있는 바, 따라서 미국 연방대법원의 기후변화대응법제에 대한 향후의 판결이 더욱 주목된다고 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  따라서 본 연구에서는 중국 고체폐기물 법제 연혁을 회고하면서 중국 고체폐기물법제가 전통적인 오염통제모델에서 순환 및 재사용 모델을 중심으로 변화해가는 과도기임을 명확히 하면서, 중국 고체폐기물 법제발전을 촉진하고자 하였다. 또한 중국의 고체폐기물법의 입법 목적, 입법원칙, 고체폐기물 법제 연구의 동향과 폐기물처리의 원칙인 감량화 · 무해화 · 자원화를 도입한 소관부처별 다양한 고체폐기물(예를 들면 공업폐기물 농업폐기물 포장 등) 및 특수 고체폐기물(위험폐기물 · 전자제품 · 자동차 등)의 관련 제도와 규정을 등을 소개하고자 하였다. 그 중에서도

  현재 국회에 계류 중인 로봇기본법안이나, 유럽연합 의회의 로봇관련 규칙에 따르자면 개괄적으로 로봇에 대하여 전자인간과 같은 나름의 법적 지위를 부여하고자 하는 노력도 확인할 수 있다.
  따라서 뇌의 활용과 인간다움을 기준으로 강한 AI, 약한 AI로 나누어 보호받을 로봇과 규제의 대상이 되는 로봇으로 구분 짓는 방식이 적절하다고 생각한다. 다만, ‘강한 AI’와 ‘약한 AI’를 나누는 기준에 법적인 정당성을 부여하기 위해서는 인공지능의 기능적 수준을 넘어서는 인류에 대한 이해를 반영해야 한다.
  또한 인간 유사 로봇을 제외한 일반적인 인공지능에 대한 규제는 상대적으로 윤리적 문제가 없기 때문에 설정이 용이하며, 따라서 일반적인 인공지능에 대한 규제와 관련해서는 윤리적 고민에서 벗어나 기본적으로 그 개발단계에서부터 인간에게 우호적인 행동을 하도록 설계되어야 한다는 ‘Friendliness theory’ 또는 인간에게 유용하고 혜택을 주는 ‘Beneficient AI 개발원칙을 탑재하는 것도 가능할 것으로 본다. 자동차와 같이 등록제로 운영되는 것이 요구될 수 있으며, 생성에서 폐기까지 국가차원의 관리와 규제의 도입이 고려될 수 있다. 살인 로봇 등 일반적 규제를 넘어선 로봇 산업에 대해서는 허가제를 실시하게 하거나, 제조사의 책임재산의 확보, 제조사 책임 강화 및 로봇소유자에 대한 필수 보험가입 등도 규제책의 일환으로 검토해 볼만하다. 인간에게 미칠 수 있는 다양한 영향력과 그 대응방안에 대하여 공개적인 논의를 이끌어낼 수 있는 전문위원회의 설립을 통해 사회적 공감대를 배경으로 규제의 방향을 설계해 나가는 것도 필요할 것으로 생각한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이 논문은 넓은 세계와 접속되지만 결국 식민지를 거쳤던 한국의 근대를 살았던 사람들에게 이러한 의미를 지닌 사건이 무엇이었는지를 알아보고자 한 것이다. 이를 위해 한국 근대에 출현한 잡지로, 국사편찬위원회의 홈페이지에서 원문을 제공하여 연구자들은 물론 일반인들도 폭넓게 활용하고 있으며, 종합 잡지로서 특정한 분야를 넘어 당시 일상생활을 위한 다양한 정보들을 담고 있는 19종의 잡지에서 ‘이전’, ‘이후’ 상당 어구의 좌측에 등장하는 사건을 추출하여 그 빈도와 주요 사건들의 용례를 검토했다.
분석 결과 1차 세계대전을 비롯하여 중일전쟁, 만주사변, 러시아혁명 등과 같이 국제적 사건이 상위를 차지하였다. 이처럼 국제적인 사건들이 시대 변화의 지표로서 빈번하게 등장한다는 것은, 적어도 개항 이후 세계와 접속된다는 ‘근대’라는 시대의 성격을 보여준다. 하지만 이러한 국제적인 사건들이 변화의 기점으로 등장하는 기사들은 국제 정세, 해외 소식을 전하는 기사들을 중심으로 문예, 국외 유명인들의 이력, 재외 동포의 동정 등을 전하는 내용이 대부분이었다. 즉 1차 세계대전을 비롯한 국제적인 사건은 높은 출현 빈도에 비해 이들 사건이 촉발한 즉자적인 변화와 관련된 부분에서만 변화의 기점으로서 언급되었다.
반면 국내적 성격이 강한 3?1운동이나 한일병합과 같은 사안은 1차 세계대전에 비해 상대적으로 출현 빈도가 적었다. 하지만 이 두 사건은 식민지 조선 사회 변화에 직결되는 각종 제도?법령의 변화를 초래했기 때문에 이들이 시대 구분의 결절점으로 등장하는 경우는 각종 법령, 언론, 출판, 교육 등과 같이 당시를 살아가던 이들의 일상에 직결되는 사안들이 많았다. 특히 3?1운동 이후 사회주의가 유입되고 운동 전선이 분화됨에 따라 조선에서의 민족?사회 운동은 새로운 양상을 띄었다. 때문에 민족?사회 운동에 대한 기사에서 3?1운동은 주요한 변곡점으로 매우 빈번하게 등장하였다. 뿐만 아니라 1930년대 들어서면 전차의 변화와 증가, 여성의 패션 변화, 자동차의 증가와 이용 등과 같은 사안에서도 3?1운동을 기점으로 당시를 설명하는 경우가 등장하였다. 3?1운동과 별다른 접점이 보이지 않는 일상의 영역에서도 현재 상황을 설명하기 위한 사회 변화의 주요한 분기점으로서 ‘기미년 이후’와 같은 표현이 관용적으로 사용되는 것이다. 이러한 의미에서 3?1운동은 운동사적 혹은 정치사적 의미를 넘어 한국의 근대를 살았던 이들의 일상의 변화에 가장 큰 흔적을 남긴 사건이었다고 할 수 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  여기에서 문제는 산업혁명이 인간가치의 침해나 또는 사람들의 직업에 대한 위협이 되고 수용지연에 따른 혼란을 초래하는 등 사회적 경제적인 위기와 기회를 동시에 몰고 왔다는 측면과 사람이 살고 있는 물리적인 공간을 가상의 사이버공간과 혼합해버리는 4차 산업혁명의 기술이 인간대체기술이라는 측면에 있는 것이다.
  4차 산업혁명의 핵심인 인공지능기술과 정보네트워크기술의 결합체인 지능정보기술의 초지능화 및 초연결화를 통하여 인간은 과연 더 인간답고 행복하고 안전하게 삶을 영위할 수 있을까? 융복합 연결이 강조되면서 오히려 사회의 양극화가 더 심화되고 있는 것은 아닌가？ 하는 걱정이 있는 것도 사실이다. 우리사회에 양극화 등 분열적 갈등이 심화된다면， 정부로서는 그 통치기능에 위기를 초래할 수도 있다고 보아 정부의 역할과 위기의 대처에 있어서 형사정책인 문제로 노동시장 및 인구변화에 따른 갈등관리, 사물인터넷이나 빅데이터 그리고 불록체인의 등장에 따른 정보보안과 개인의 사생활 보호, 자율주행 자동차나 드론의 등장에 따른 안전성의 확보, 바이오 공학기술에 따른 인간 생명윤리 및 개인의 사생활 보호 등의 문제가 제기될 수 있을 것이다.
  기술발전에 부수해서 따르는 부작용의 문제를 더 나은 기술발전으로 해결할 수는 없다. 4차 산업혁명시대 형사정책의 원칙도 민주적인 절차와 제도로 발전되어야 한다고 본다. 지능정보기술 발전의 긍정적인 효과는 수용해야 하고 부정적인 영향에 대응하는 정책은 4차 산업혁명시대의 사회변화 속에서 삶의 질을 중시하는 국민의 안전과 자유권 확보에 집중해서 수립되어야 할 것이다. 물론 가상현실과 증강현실 등에 관한 기술개발자들 역시 자신의 창작물에 안전개념을 구축해야 할 것이다.
  우리사회의 형사정책 전문가 역시 정보기반 디지털환경을 이해하고 활용할 수 있는 지능정보기술을 현실적인 문제해결에 적용하는 능력·정보흐름을 볼 수 있는 비판적인 사고·첨단기술의 사회 작동 원리에 대한 이해력 등 정보 네트워크 문해력인 디지털문해력(digital literacy) 배양이 요구된다.　국가정책 수립에 있어서도 형사정책적인 성찰에 의한 과제 해결노력이 다른 분야의 노력과 결합해야 될 것이며, 개인정보보호 관련법들은 정보의 활용 보다는 보호에 비중을 두고 있는 편이어서 AI나 빅데이터 등 기술발전을 지연시킨다는 비판을 받고 있으나 개인정보보호와 경제가치로 환산되는 데이터를 보호할 수 있는 균형방안이 모색되어야 할 것이다.

  적발되거나 사고가 나지 않을 것이라 전망하는 음주운전자들에게, 형벌강화는 효과가 떨어진다. 중요한 것은 그러한 낙관을 교정할 ‘집행의 확실성’이다. ‘경찰이 잡는 범죄’였던 음주운전죄는 어느덧, ‘시민과 함께 검거하는 범죄’가 되었다. 2018년 들어서는, 누군가의 신고로 음주운전을 잡는 비율이 30%를 넘어섰다. 집에 도착하기도 전에 차로 돌아감으로써 ‘사적 공간에 귀환하였다’고 여기는 음주운전자들을 ‘공적 공간으로 가시화’하는 수단으로, 신고포상제가 고려될 수 있다.
  처벌과 같은 ‘외적 동기’가 앞서면, 규범을 지켜 행동한다는 ‘내적 동기’는 밀려난다. 처벌을 죄책감을 덜고 죗값을 치렀다고 정당화하는 ‘가격’으로 여기게 만든다. 형벌의 성패는 ‘순전 이기적 유형’의 범죄를 억지하고자 도입한 처벌규범이 ‘약한 준수형’에게 ‘가치’로 표현될 수 있는가에 달려 있다. 사람들은 ‘다른 사람들은 무엇을 옳다고 생각할 것인가’(규범적 기대)보다 ‘다른 사람들은 실제로 어떻게 행동할 것인가’(경험적 기대)에 따라 행동하곤 한다. 두 기대가 괴리된 상황에서 형벌강화는 역설적으로 ‘많은 사람들이 규범을 지키지 않고 있다’는 신호를 줄 수 있다. 약한 준수형이 갖는 경험적 기대의 방향을 바꾸고 내적동기를 강화하기 위해서는 비형법적 제재수단을 함께 활용하여야 한다. 특히, 음주운전 공무원에 대한 징계원칙을 확고하게 세워야 한다.
  음주운전 처벌조항이 가격 아닌 형벌로 기능할 수 있으려면, 벌금형 상한이 100만 원이 안 되는 행정형벌 조항들을 과태료 부과 대상으로 전환하고, 나머지 벌금형 조항들을 물가, 국민소득, 자유형과 등가성을 고려하여 재정비하여야 한다. 일본에서 직수입한 위험운 전치사상죄의 구성요건을 재검토하여야 한다. 순전 이기적 유형에 대하여 자동차 몰수 · 추징을 적극 활용하고, 사업용 차량에 대한 시동잠금장치 도입을 논의하여야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

글의 전반부에는 자발적 리콜에 관련한 규정의 쟁점들을 분석한다. 첫째로 늦장리콜 규제의 근거가 되는 자동차관리법 제31조의 ‘지체 없이’라는 법문상의 표현이 논리적으로나 해석상으로 사문과 다름이 없다는 점, 둘째로 자발적 리콜의 불이행을 처벌하는 규정은 늦장리콜을 처벌하지 않고 있으며 위헌성의 문제를 가지고 있다는 점, 셋째로 그 처벌의 요건이 되는 ‘안전기준’은 미비의 상태이고 ‘안전운행에 지장을 주는 경우’는 불명확한 개념이라 이를 처벌한다는 것은 위헌성이 농후하거나 현실적으로 가능하지 않다는 점 등이다.
강제적 리콜 관련규정을 분석한 글의 중반부에서는, 먼저 강제적 리콜 결정에 바탕이 되는 자료 제출에 대하여 처벌규정이 마련되어 있지 않다는 점, 다음으로 자발적 리콜 불이행에 대해서는 강력한 행정형벌을 마련하고 있는∨데 반하여 그 책임의 정도가 더 큰 강제적 리콜 불이행의 경우에 형사제재가 전무하다는 점, 마지막으로 강제적 리콜 여부를 결정하는 심의위원회의 구성에 있어 공정성 확보에 심대한 오류가 있다는 점 등의 쟁점들을 분석한다.
이러한 분석을 기반으로 글의 후반부에서는 법정책적 관점의 이슈들을 검토한다. 먼저 자동차 리콜은 전형적인 행정행위이며 그 일차적 주체는 정부이지 자동차제작자 등이 아니라는 바탕위에서 논의가 시작되어야 한다는 점, 그리고 강제적 리콜은 자발적 리콜을 압박하는 기능을 해야 하고 제재의 무게중심을 강제적 리콜 쪽으로 이동시키는 것이 바람직하다는 점, 마지막으로 리콜의 진행과정에 있어 중요한 개별적 단계마다 형사제재를 분산?배치하는 방안이 리콜의무 불이행이라는 종국적인 결과에다 형사제재를 부과하는 현행의 방식보다 효과적이라는 점 등이 그것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

다국적 기업의 지식 이전을 설명하는 분석틀은 1) 지식 자체의 성격, 2) 본사-자회사 간의 관계, 3) 본사의 역할, 4) 자회사의 흡수 능력이라는 4가지 변수로 구성된다.
이러한 분석틀을 적용한 본 논문의 결론은 다음과 같다. 도요타는 본사에서 해외 자회사로 지식을 점진적으로 이전하는 방식으로 신차 개발을 추진했다고 한다면, 현대차는 본사에 지식이 집중된 상태에서 해외 자회사로의 지식 이전을 최소화하는 방식으로 신차 개발을 추진해 왔다.
결론적으로 도요타와 현대차의 지식 이전 방식의 차이에는 모국 본사의 역할이 가장 중요하게 작용한다. 신차 개발이라는 지식의 성격 상 지식 이전을 위해서는 행위자의 지속적 노력이 요구되는데, 두 기업을 비교하면 본사의 거버넌스 구조 뿐 아니라 자회사에 대한 경영 전략에서도 차이가 뚜렷하게 나타난다. 본사의 역할이 지식이전의 중심적 변수인 것이다. 자회사의 흡수 능력의 차이는 본사의 이러한 역할에 누적적으로 영향을 받으면서 부차적 변수로 작용하고 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,"미중 무역분쟁과 주요 농축산물(대두, 돼지고기) 수급 전망",,"? 트럼프 행정부는 미국 우선주의 기조하에 제조업 보호와 무역적자 해소 등을 목적으로 강경한 통상정책을 추진하고 있으며, 이로 인해 대미 무역흑자 규모가 3,700억 달러에 달하는 중국과의 무역마찰 심화
  ? 미국은 3월 23일 ‘무역확장법 232조’에 따라 철강과 알루미늄에 각각 25%와 10%의 관세를 부과했고, 7월 6일 ‘통상법 301조’에 근거하여 340억 달러에 달하는 중국산 IT ? 의료 ? 로봇 ? 항공 등의 첨단제품 818개 품목에 대해 25% 관세를 부과
  ? 중국 또한 트럼프의 지지기반인 미 중서부 지역을 겨냥하여 대두와 돼지고기 등의 농축산물에 두 차례 보복관세를 부과하는 맞대응을 함으로써 양국 간 무역분쟁 격화
? 중국이 올해 보복관세를 부과한 미국산 농림축산물은 309개이며, 이들 품목의 전체 수입액 703억 달러 중에서 미국산 수입액은 197억 달러로 28% 차지
  ? 품목에 따라 부과되는 관세율의 최대 규모는 ‘MFN 관세율+50%’로 두 차례 보복관세를 받은 돼지고기가 이에 해당
  전체 농식품 교역에서는, 중국의 대미국 수입의존도가 미국의 대중국 수출의존도보다 2배가량 높지만, 대두와 수수는 미국의 대중국 수출의존도가 매우 높고, 돼지고기는 중국과 멕시코가 동시에 보복조치를 취한 상태이기 때문에, 단기적으로 이들 품목의 가격하락과 함께 미국의 수출물량 해소가 쉽지 않을 전망
  중국은 단기적으로 수입가격 상승과 수급불안정을 감내하고, 장기적으로 남미와 유럽, 호주로의 수입선 다변화, 대체작물 수입 확대, 일대일로 주변 국가들과의 교역증대, 국내 생산장려정책 등을 통해 주요 농축산물의 미국의존도를 낮출 계획
  국내 채유용 대두의 올해 소비물량에 대한 구매가 종료되었지만, 내년 상반기 도입물량은 가격경쟁력이 높아진 미국산 대두의 비중이 증가할 것으로 예상. 한편, 사료효율 측면에서 남미산이 선호되는 대두박의 경우 중국의 수입수요 확대로 인해 당분간 가격상승이 예상되지만, 무역분쟁이 장기화될 경우 일정 부분 미국으로의 수입전환이 예상됨.
  현재 수입 돼지고기 재고도 포화상태이고, 국내 사육규모 또한 역대 최대 수준에 도달해 있어 미중 통상 마찰이 지속될 경우, 사료가격 인상과 수입가격 하락이 겹치면서 국내 양돈산업에 부정적인 영향을 미칠 것으로 우려
  한편, 한 ? 미 FTA 개정 및 자동차 등으로 미국과 통상협상을 진행 중인 우리나라 또한 미중 무역분쟁을 예의주시해야 하는 입장임. 더욱이 미국은 중국시장이 봉쇄됨에 따라 여분의 농축산물 수출물량을 기존 수입국들이 흡수하도록 통상압력을 행사할 가능성도 있기 때문에, 통상당국의 선제적 대비가 필요",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

국내에서 아직까지 자율주행차 운행 중 사고가 발생하였다는 보도는 없었다. 그러나 미국의 경우 자율주행차의 운행으로 인한 사고가 여럿 발생한 바 있고, 그 중에는 사망사고도 포함되어 있다.
지금처럼 자율주행기술이 급속하게 발전하여 자율주행차가 상용화 된다면 위와 같은 사고가 발생할 것은 자명한 일이며, 그러한 사고들은 기존의 자동차 사고와는 다른 새로운 법적패러다임이 요구된다. 왜냐하면 완전한 자율주행차는 핵심적인 기술인 자율주행시스템이나 인공지능의 오류 등과 같은 원인으로 사고가 발생할 수도 있고 사고원인이 불분명한 경우도 존재할 수 있기 때문이다. 이에 현시점에서 자율주행차와 관련된 형사책임의 문제는 기존의 법체계를 단순 재구성하는 수준을 넘는 근본적인 변화가 필요하다.

GPS정보를 활용한 자동차 운전, 무기 발사를 비롯한 민간 및 군사적 목적 등 인간의 일상적인 삶은 우주에 크게 의존하고 있다. 특히, 군사적 측면에서 우주는 필수불가결한 존재가 되고 있다. 우주의 군사적 가치와 관련이론을 보면 우주를 성역의 대상으로 인식하는 학파, 통제대상으로서 우주, 고도의 작전영역으로서 우주 그리고 생존성 제고의 대상으로 분류할 수 있다. 그러나 우주와 관련된 4개 학파 중 어느 하나의 사상만이 타당할 수는 없다. 오늘날 우주는 군사적인 측면에서 고도의 작전적 영역이며 통제의 대상이다. 또한, 우주자산과 관련시설들은 위협에 취약하여 생존성 제고의 대상이기도 하다. 이러한 점에서 미국의 안보전략과 우주전략은 미국의 국익을 최우선시하고 잠재적인 위협세력에 대한 억제력을 행사하는 영역이다. 지상전을 비롯한 다양한 전쟁영역에서 아군의 승리를 보장하고 적의 능력을 저지할 수 있는 고도의 작전영역이기도 하다. 이러한 점에 기반하여 미국은 새로운 우주전략과 지침을 설정하고 있다. 특히, 미국의 트럼프 대통령은 2017년 취임 후 국가우주위원회를 부활하고 새로운 우주전략과 지침을 발령하였다. 그리고 2019년에는 우주사령부를 설치하는 등 미국의 지배적인 위치를 지속하고 안전한 우주활동을 통해 미국의 국가안보를 보장하기 위해 노력을 기울이고 있다. 미국 안보에 있어서 우주의 중요성은 최근의 이라크전에서도 입증되었다. 미국은 예상되는 도전에 직면하여 우주통제에 중점을 두고 있다. 우주장비의 방해 없는 이용을 보장할 수 있는 능력 구비를 통해 미국의 안보와 국익을 지키고자 하고 있다. 미국 우주사령부 비전 2020은 전 영역에서 우세를 요구하고 있다. 우주는 지상, 해상, 공중과 함께 4차원 공간의 전쟁이라고 강조하면서 그 중요성을 강조하고 있다. 최근 미국은 ‘미국 우선’의 우주전략을 추진하고 우주에서 우월적인 위치를 지속하고 하는 것으로 평가할 수 있다. 미국은 안보상 우주에서 지배적인 지위를 유지하는 것이 매우 중요하며, 우주전략도 우주개발이 미국의 국익을 지키는 데 매우 중요한 요소로 인식하고 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

물피 교통사고는 경찰청에서 사고 유형에 대한 분석이 이루어지지 않아 개문사고 건수는 확인할 수 없으나, 실무에서 개문사고의 신고 건수는 상당한 것이 현실이다. 이러한 개문사고의 신고 건수는 매년 증가될 것으로 예상됨에 따라 이에 대한 명확한 법 해석으로 효율적인 법 집행의 근거를 마련하고자 판례의 취지, 유형별 사례를 연구하여 개선 방향을 제시하였다.
연구자는 교통사고의 정의를 기초로 행위자인 운전자의 지위와 업무의 개념을 중심으로 개문행위를 유형별로 살펴보아, 차량 소유주가 주차된 차량을 운전하기 위해 문을 열다가 발생한 사고, 차량 소유주가 주차된 차량에서 물건을 찾기 위해 문을 열다가 발생한 사고, 운전자 이외의 자가 기타 용무로 차량의 앞·뒷문을 밖에서 열다가 발생한 사고 등은 개문의 행위자가 ‘운전자’의 지위에 있지 않고, 사회성·계속성이 개념 요소인 ‘업무’에 해당하지 않으므로 교통사고가 아닌 안전사고로 처리하여야 함이 타당하다고 본다. 또한 국가적 차원에서 주차장 면적을 합리적으로 확대하고 이를 강제하는 규정을 완비하며, 주차구획선의 개선 및 더치리치 캠페인을 활성화하여 개문사고의 발생을 방지 내지 최소화하려는 노력이 필요하다. 이와 더불어 경찰청 교통사고조사 매뉴얼 및 교통사고조사규칙 제21조의 보완 그리고 경찰청이 이미 일선에 하달한 관련 지침의 수정이 필수적이고, 이로 인해 경찰관들이 사고현장에서 국민들에게 명쾌한 법 집행과 행정서비스를 제공하여 경찰 및 수사기관에 대한 신뢰성 향상 나아가 교통사고처리특례법의 목적인 피해의 신속한 회복과 국민 생활의 편의 증진을 기대하는 바이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

고령자의 교통사고 사망자의 점유율은 전체 교통사고 사망자에 비해 매우 높게 나타나고 있는데 이는 고령자의 교통사고가 많이 발생하고 사고의 발생 시에는 그 피해의 정도가 심하여 사망에 이르게 되는 경우가 다른 연령층에 비해 높게 나타난다는 것이 문제이다.
이러한 문제가 나타나게 되는 배경으로는 첫째, 우리사회에서 고령자의 교통안전에 대한 문제의 인식이 미비하고 이에 대한 법, 제도적 방안이 실질적인 효과를 거두기에는 미흡하기 때문이다. 두 번째는 고령자들은 신체적 특성으로 교통사고에 더 쉽게 노출되거나 비슷한 사고의 충격이라 할지라도 다른 연령층에 비해 위중한 사고로 이어질 가능성이 크다. 세 번째는 다수의 경험을 통해 교통법규의 위반을 대수롭지 않게 생각하는 고령자들의 교통 문화적 특성이 고령자의 교통사고 피해에 있어서 지속적으로 증가하게 하는 원인이 된다고 할 수 있을 것이다.
따라서 증가하고 있는 고령자 교통사고에 대한 전문적인 연구를 통해 적절한 대응방안을 강구해야 하며, 이는 단순히 고령자의 교통사고를 줄인다는 측면에서 뿐만 아니라 고령자를 위한 사회복지 차원에서 접근하는 정책의 방향을 확립해야 할 필요성이 대두되고 있는 현실이다. 이에 고령자의 교통사고에 있어서의 예방 및 피해 구제를 위한 고령자의 교통 안전권에 및 노인보호구역의 확대 및 의무설치에 대한 법제화가 이루어져야 하며, 고령자의 운전면허증의 반납을 지방자치단체의 정책에 맡길 것이 아닌 법제에 명문화하여야 할 것으로 생각된다. 또한 고령운전자의 위험성인식 프로그램을 통해 사고의 위험성에 대하여 교육을 하여야 하며 고령자들을 대상으로 하는 교통사고 예방프로그램을 실시하는데 있어 VR프로그램이나 시뮬레이션을 도입하여 실질적으로 교통사고의 위험성을 고지하는 고령자 교통안전 프로그램을 명문화하여야 할 것이다. 그리고 고령자가 교통사고 발생 시 보조인제도 도입하여 피해구제를 통한 고령자의 교통안전에 한발 더 다가가야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4차 산업혁명의 본격화와 함께 자유로운 국경 간 데이터이전을 보장하기 위한 통상규범의 필요성이 커지고 있다. CPTPP가 국경 간 데이터이전 조항을 최초로 의무화한 가운데, 미국과 유럽은 이를 규율하기 위한 통상규범에 대한 논의를 본격화하고 있다. 4차 산업혁명 기술의 총아인 자율주행차도 자율주행 알고리즘(AI) 개발 및 업그레이드, 지역?고객별 맞춤형 마케팅, 자동차 보험상품 개발, 신규 비즈니스 창출 등을 위해서는 빅데이터 수집?활용이 필수적이며, 이를 위해 자유로운 국경 간 데이터이전을 법?제도적으로 보장하는 것이 중요하다. 이에 이 논문은 자유로운 국경 간 데이터이전을 실효적으로 보장하기 위한 통상규범을 도출하기 위해 다음과 같이 검토를 진행하였다. 첫째, 기존 개인정보보호 원칙과 자율주행차 데이터 수집?활용간 균형과 조화를 모색하는 것이 어려울 수 있다는 점을 분석하였다. 둘째, 국경 간 데이터이전과 개인정보보호 문제에 대한 논의를 선도하고 있는 미국, 유럽연합의 개인정보보호법, 자율주행차 관련 법률을 분석하여 정책방향을 검토하였다. 셋째, 국경 간 데이터이전과 개인정보보호에 대한 통상규범 논의방향을 검토하기 위해 미국과 유럽연합의 통상정책을 분석하였다. 이를 토대로, 높은 수준의 국경 간 데이터이전을 보장하기 위한 시론적(試論的) 통상규범을 도출하였다. 시론적 통상규범은 ①데이터 활용 촉진을 위해 개인정보보호 핵심원칙에 대한 공통규범을 마련하고, ②개인정보 세분화 및 이에 따른 개인정보보호 수준의 차등적 적용을 기본방향으로 한다. 4차 산업혁명 시대의 가장 중요한 생산요소인 데이터의 국경 간 이전은 이제 거스를 수 없는 대세인 만큼, 통상규범 수립에 적극 대응하여 국익을 극대화하여야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

주요 선진국들은 국방 신뢰성 관련 최첨단 인프라를 공공기관에 투자하여 제품의 신뢰성 평가에 대한 활동을 강화하여 왔고 무기체계의 신뢰성 보증을 위한 최고의 국제적 평가기관들을 다수 확보하고 있다. 특히 미국은 국방, 우주항공, 전력 등 국가 주요 산업에 대한 신뢰성 강화를 강력히 추진하여 왔고 국방 신뢰성 분야는 민군기술협력 차원에서 인공위성, 자동차 및 전자산업에 응용되어 품질관리 기법과 더불어 각 산업의 필수기술로 발전하여 그 결과가 괄목할만하다는 평가를 받고 있다.
한국은 ‘부품ㆍ소재 신뢰성 평가 기반 구축사업 마스터플랜’을 마련하면서 신뢰성 향상을 위한 사업을 본격적으로 시작하였지만 초기 신뢰성 예측정책은 군의 전력화 시기만을 고려한 결과 효과적이지 못했다는 비평을 받아왔다. 따라서 전문성, 효율성, 투명성 및 경쟁력 강화를 위해 제도적으로 무기체계의 신뢰도, 가용도 및 정비도 요소를 예측하고 평가하여 국방 신뢰성을 증대시키는 지속적인 노력이 필요하다. 향후 효과적인 신뢰성 업무수행을 위해서는 사업 및 무기체계의 절차와 특성에 따라 신뢰성 목표 값 정량화, 분석기준 설정, 신뢰성 분석, 시험 및 평가, DB 구축 및 분석 등이 필수적이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그러므로 우리의 자유는 대부분 환경부담(부하, 하중)의 자유이다. 우리가 자유의 실현 가운데 행하는 것의 대부분이 어떠한 환경 침해적 작용을 하게 된다. 환경의 보호를 담당하는 법 규정은 환경부담의 자유를 제약하고, 이에 의해 필연적으로 자유 그 자체, 즉 기본법이 제2조 제1항에서 보장하고자 하는 각인이 희망하는 무언가를 행하거나 하지 않거나 하는 자유로서의 행위자유를 제약하고 있다. 환경을 실효적으로 보호하기 위해서는 당장 무한계로 구상된 행위자유에 대한 광범위한 제약이 불가결한 것은 의심의 여지가 없다.
하지만 환경의 법적보호가 보다 포괄적 그리고 보다 완전한 형태로 형성되면 될수록, 점점 많은 행위영역도 점점 많은 사람이 환경법상의 자유의 제약을 받게 된다. 또한 법적으로 정해진 환경보호가 보다 철저하게 되면 될수록 환경이용자에 의한 자유제한은 보다 심각해 진다.
환경의 이용은 인간 자신에게 있어도, 다른 생명체에 있어도, 생태학 상으로 필요사항이다. 환경이용이 유해하게 되는 것은 생태학 상의 상호관계가 밸런스를 잃게 될 때, 또는 재생 불가능한 리소스(자원)가 과잉으로 소비될 때이다. 하지만 여기에서 오늘날 우리의 현실적인 문제가 있다. 오늘날 우리를 위협하는 것은, 이론적으로만 생각할 수 있는 과도한 환경보호에 의한 인간의 생존기반의 박탈이 아니라, 오히려 과소한 환경보호에 의한 이 생존기반의 파괴이다. 전체주의적 환경보호 국가에 의한 자유의 부정이라고 하는 이론적 가능성이 오늘날 현실적인 문제가 아니라, 환경 황폐가 인간의 자유에도 미칠 수 있는 영향이 문제이다.
그렇다면 환경보호를 보다 훌륭히 성취하기 위해서는, 더욱 국가의 규율이 필요한 것인가? 그렇지 않으면, 명령이나 금지규범의 완화에 의한 자유를 확대하고, 동시에 환경보호의 실효성을 높이는 것이 가능한가? 결론적으로 이 문제는 일반적으로 답변될 것이 아니라, 구체적으로 개개의 환경법규와 복잡하게 관련된 작용분석을 근거로 하여서만 가능할 것이다. 본고에서는 그러한 상세한 분석을 제시하고자 하는 것은 아니라, 제기된 문제에 암묵 가운데 포함된 가정, 즉 자유 제약적 규범의 폐지에 의해 자유가 확대된다고 하는 가정에 대해서 논하고자 한다.

노인인구의 증가가 경제구조에 미치는 영향이 점차 커지면서 TV, 신문, 잡지의 광고에서 노인을 다루는 비중이 늘어나기 시작했다. 1970-90년대까지만 해도 노인이 등장하는 광고는 주로 보험 및 의약품에 치중되어 있었으며, 노인은 대개 가족관계라는 틀 안에서 손자를 돌보는 상투적인 할아버지와 할머니의 역할, 또는 경제적으로 의존적 존재이자 가족들에게 부양의 부담을 안기는 존재로 그려졌다. 이는 노인에 대한 사회적 편견과 부정적인 인식을 재생산하는 결과를 낳았다.
그러나 21세기에 와서 노인을 액티브시니어 Active Senior로 정의하면서 노인을 쾌활하게 소비하는 젊고 건강한 세대로 표현하는 광고가 늘어나기 시작했다. 노인을 수발의 대상으로 묘사한 의약품광고 또는 의료기기상품광고는 눈에 띠게 줄었으며, 그 대신에 노인을 새로운 소비주체로 부상시키거나, 노인의 잠재력을 존중하며 노인을 역동적으로 묘사한 광고(자동차/가구/보험광고)가 많이 늘었으며, 가족공동체에서 노인의 존재가치를 강조한 광고(마트광고)도 주목받고 있다. 이러한 광고에서 노인들은 사회의 주류세력으로 등장한다. 대개 건강 및 경제적 능력을 갖추고 있어서 스스로 삶의 질을 높이기 위해 능동적으로 참여하는 캐릭터를 구축하고 있다는 점이 특징이다. 이제는 다양한 취미 및 여가, 여유, 즐김, 자기실현, 지혜 및 경륜, 강한 독립성 등이 노년의 삶을 나타내는 새로운 키워드로 등장하기 시작한다.
본 연구에서는 광고가 노인을 어떻게 묘사하고 있는지, 노년에 관한 다양한 담론들을 어떻게 담아내고 있는지, 그리고 어떠한 새로운 노인이미지를 창출하고 있는지를 도출할 것이다. 아울러 광고가 고령화시대의 노인상을 얼마나 잘 반영하고 있는지, 실제 노인의 삶이 광고에 어떻게 묘사되어있는지에 주목하고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

연구방법 선행연구를 토대로 평가요인을 도출하고 가설을 설정한다. 설문은 G시 지역에 거주하고 자동차에 관심이 많으며 자차로 출퇴근하는 일반인을 선정하여 동영상을 관람하게 한 후 조사를 실시한다. 자료의 처리는 요인분석, 신뢰성분석, 상관관계분석, 가설검증을 위해 독립표본 T-Test를 실시하여 디지털 미디어 파사드와 AI 미디어 파사드의 광고 효과에 대해 검증한다.
연구 결과 디지털 미디어 파사드와 AI 미디어 파사드 간의 주목성, 다양성, 몰입성, 그리고 브랜드 태도에 있어서 차이가 있었으며 AI 미디어 파사드의 수치가 디지털 미디어 파사드의 수치보다 통계적으로 모두 높게 나타났다. 특히 몰입성과 인지적 요소는 AI 미디어 파사드가 디지털 미디어 파사드보다 훨씬 큰 효과를 보이는 것으로 나타났다.
결론 두 유형의 광고에 대한 소비자 태도의 검증은 4차 산업혁명의 시대에 적절한 광고전략의 선택과 소비자 행동의 이해에 도움이 될 것이며, 또한 AI 미디어 파사드에 대한 광고 평가요인의 검증을 처음으로 시도했다는 점에서 다른 연구와 차별성이 있다고 사료된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,서울시민의 환경보건 위험인식과 정책 필요성에 영향을 미치는 요인 = Factors Contributing to Seoul Citizens’ Perception of Environmental Health Risks and Policy Needs,"심리측정패러다임,위험인식,환경보건위해,건강위해,Psychometric paradigm,Risk perception,Environmental health risk,Health risk","연구목적: 서울시민이 느끼는 위험인식과 환경보건위해에 대한 의견, 위험인식과 정책 필요성에 미치는 영향을 계량심리학적 방법에 따른 분석을 통해 환경보건정책 수립의 기초자료 구축을 목적으로 하였다.
연구방법: 자료는 서울시에 1년 이상 거주한 만 19세 이상 성인 남녀 2,000명을 대상으로 2017년 8월 총 6일간의 온라인 설문조사로 수집되었다. 위험인식에 관한 도구는 심리측정패러다임 연구를 참고하여 환경보건분야로 한정한 20개의 위해요소를 도출하고 6개의 위험특성으로 측정하였다. 또한 일반적인 위험인식과 예방 정책 필요성을 추가하고 요인분석을 통해 위험인식 구조를 2개로 축소한 후 그에 미치는 영향 정도를 측정하였다.
연구결과: 20개 환경보건위해요인에 대한 일반적인 위험인식 순위를 성별, 연령별, 혼인상태별 평균값 순으로 나열한 결과 방사능의 위험인식이 가장 높았고 정책 필요성 순위는 미세먼지가 가장 높았으며 항목마다 집단별로 유의한 차이가 있었다. 서울시민의 환경보건위해요인에 대한 서울시민의 일반적인 위험인식을 평균값에 따라 도출한 결과 방사능, 산업폐수, 환경호르몬 순으로 위험하다고 인식하고 있었다. 정책의 필요성에 대한 응답으로는 미세먼지, 자동차 배기가스, 산업폐수 순으로 필요하다고 응답하였다. 6개의 위험특성은 위험에 대한 두려운 정도와 위험의 통제가능성 정도의 2개의 속성과 4개 유형으로 분류되었다. 위험에 대한 두려운 정도가 높을수록, 위험에 대한 통제가능성이 낮을수록 위험인식과 정책 필요성 모두에 영향을 주는 것으로 나타났다.
결론: 서울시민이 체감하는 환경보건위해는 성별, 연령별, 혼인상태별로 차이가 있었으며, 위험의 두려운 정도와 통제가능성 정도에 따라 일반적인 위험인식과 정책 필요성이 변화하였다. 환경보건정책 집행 시 이러한 점을 고려하여 우선순위를 파악한 적절한 조정과 중재가 필요할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이를 위해, 본 연구에서는 ‘이세돌 vs 알파고’ 시점인 2016년 3월을 포함하여 2016년 1월부터 2017년 12월까지 2년 동안의 인공지능과 관련된 사회적인 이슈들을 파악하고 온라인상에서 발생되는 사회적 여론에 대하여다 범주 감성을 분석하고자 한다. 이를 위하여 국내 대표적인 포털 사이트에서 인공지능 관련 뉴스의 수와 관련된 뉴스 제목, 뉴스의 댓글을 웹 크롤링(Web Crawling) 하였다. 사회적 여론에 대한 다 범주 감성 분석은 논의되는 이슈들의 중요성을 고려하여 단순 긍정 또는 부정이 아닌, 분노, 혐오, 두려움, 행복, 중립, 슬픔, 놀라움의7가지 다 범주 감성으로 분석하였다.
분석 결과, 대부분의 이벤트 기간에 대하여 1위 감성은 ‘행복’으로 나타났지만 각 키워드에 대하여 나오는 감성이 상이함을 볼 수 있었다. 또한 2016년 상반기, 하반기, 2017년 상반기, 하반기로 나누어 보았을 때 시간이지남에 따라 ‘분노’의 감성이 낮아짐을 확인하였다. 이러한 분석 결과를 바탕으로 인공지능과 관련하여 현재 논의되고 있는 다양한 이슈와 동향 파악이 가능하며, 이에 대한 대응 방안 마련에 활용이 가능할 것이다. 향후 감성 분석기의 성능 향상과 댓글에 대한 공감 및 비공감도의 가중치를 추가하여 분석한다면 사회적 여론을 보다세밀하게 파악 할 수 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,체계정당성 원리를 토대로 어린이보호구역내 업무상 과실치사상죄 가중처벌조항(소위 ?민식이법?)에 대한 법리적 검토 = A jurisprudential study on the article of aggravated punishment for a crime of professional negligence resulting in injury or death in the Children Protection Zone(so called Minsik’s Law) on the basis of Principle of justification of system,"Children Protection Zone,Act on the aggravated punishment etc. of specific crimes(so called Minsik‘s law),Principle of justification of system,Principle of proportionality between punishment and responsibility,Principle of equality.,어린이보호구역,민식이법,체계정당성의 원리,형벌과 책임간의 비례원칙,평등원칙","어린이보호구역에서는 자동차(원동기장치자전거 포함) 운전자는 어린이의 안전에 유의하면서 시속 30km 이내로 운행해야 한다. 이 의무를 위반하여 업무상 과실치사상죄를 범한 경우 「교통사고처리특례법」이 적용되어 5년 이하의 금고 또는 2,000만원 이하의 벌금에 처해진다. 그런데 소위 ‘민식이법’이라는 특별법이 신설되면서 ‘어린이보호구역’에서 ‘13세 미만 어린이를 상대로 과실로 사망에 이르게 한 경우에는 무기 또는 3년 이상의 징역’, ‘어린이를 상해에 이르게 한 경우에는 1년 이상 15년 이하의 징역 또는 500만원 이상 3,000만원 이하의 벌금’으로 변경되었다.
형벌법규의 제·개정은 국회의 고유 권한이고 법정형의 종류와 범위의 선택은 입법자의 정책적 고려에서 결정되므로, 입법자에게는 광범위한 입법형성권이 인정된다, 그러나 그러한 입법형성권은 무제한적으로 인정되는 것이 아니라, 헌법이 인정한 범위 내에서만 허용된다. 이처럼 입법자를 기속하는 원리가 체계정당성의 원리에 해당한다. 하지만 법정형의 종류와 범위가 체계정당성의 원리에 위배된다고 해서 곧바로 위헌이 되는 것이 아니라, 구체적으로 형벌과 책임간의 비례원칙이나 형벌체계상의 균형 및 평등의 원칙 등 보다 더 세부적인 기준에 위배될 때 위헌에 해당한다.
소위 ‘민식이법’은 사안적합성의 원칙에 부합하지 않는 국가기관의 의무 해태는 도외시한 채, 교통사고를 야기한 운전자에게만 책임을 부과한다는 점과 어린이 보호구역에서 발생하는 다양한 교통사고 유형을 고려하지 않고 모든 유형을 하나의 구성요건에 포섭시켜 일률적으로 법정형의 하한을 무겁게 책정했다는 점에서 형벌과 책임의 비례의 원칙에 반한다고 보여진다. 둘째, 가중처벌하기 위해서는 특별한 가중적 구성요건표지가 필요한데, 소위 ‘민식이법’은 가중적 표지가 될 수 없는 수단이나 장소를 매개로 가중처벌함으로써 동일하게 취급해야 할 것을 자의적으로 다르게 취급함으로써 평등의 원칙에 반한다고 보여진다. 마지막으로 우리 형벌체계상 과실범은 고의범보다 무겁게 처벌할 수 없는데, 소위 ‘민식이법’은 고의범인 상해죄보다 형벌의 상한이 징역형이나 벌금형에서 거의 2배 이상에 해당하여 형벌체계상의 균형에도 반한다. 따라서 소위 ‘민식이법’은 헌법에 위배되어 위헌으로 귀결될 소지가 다분하다.
우리나라 헌법은 인간의 존엄과 가치를 보장하는 기본권 존중의 이념을 바탕으로 중형위주의 가혹한 응보형주의, 즉 절대적 법정형주의의 원칙을 지양하면서 범죄인의 교육 및 개선과 사회복귀와 재범방지를 기본으로 하는 상대적 법정형주의를 취하고 있다는 점에서 소위 ‘민식이법’은 개정이 불가피하다고 보여진다.
그래서 위 법률을 개정한다면, 법관이 양형을 선택하고 선고함에 있어 인간 존중의 이념에 따른 재판을 할 수 있도록 다양한 교통사고유형을 고려하여 벌금형 신설을 포함한 형벌의 폭을 더 넓게 설정하는 것이 바람직할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

현대를 살아가는 모든 사람들은 건강하게 장수하는 삶을 꿈꾼다. 그러나 아무리 여러 조건들이 좋아졌다 하더라도 인간의 노화는 피할수 없는 현상으로, 그 결과 여러 질병에 노출되게 된다. 노인들은 그 중에서도 그동안의 인격적인 삶을 송두리째 파헤쳐 버리는 ‘치매’를 ‘암’이상으로 두려워하고 있다.
치매의 주요 특징은 인지기능 장애를 유발하여 상황판단 등을 어렵게 하며 이후로 더욱 악화되는 경향이 있다. 만약, 이런 증상이 자동차 운전 중에 나타난다면 당사자 본인을 포함한 다른 사람들의 생명과 재산에 중대한 위해를 가져올 것이다. 바로 이런 점이 치매환자에 대한 운전면허 제한의 필요 논거가 된다.
우리 도로교통법 제93조는 ‘치매’를 운전면허의 필요적 취소사유로 규정하고 있다. 여기서 치매의 정도는 법 문언상 중증은 물론하고 경증도 포함한다. 그러나 경증증상의 정도는 치매의 원인질환과 개인에 따라 다르고 그 발현횟수와 시기도 마찬가지다.
정보공개청구한 자료에 따르면 치매안심센터 등록 등, 그동안 치매환자로 공인되었더라도 이를 근거로 운전면허를 취소한 사례는 아직 없었다. 그러나 고령자의 자가운전에 대한 욕구와 전술한 치매의 주요 특징으로 인하여, 머지 않아 이 문제에 대한 논의를 활발히 진행할 필요성이 예상된다. 이런 상황을 대비하여 운전면허 취소처분에 대한 치매환자의 법적 적응성을 높일수 있는 법제정비가 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

스마트시티는 인공지능, 빅데이터, IoT 등 4차 산업혁명의 다양한 혁신기술의 융합뿐만 아니라 건설, 통신, 자동차, 보안산업 등과 같은 기존 산업간의 협업이 필수적이다. 따라서 스마트시티는 4차 산업혁명 시대의 종합 플랫폼이라 할 수 있다. 스마트시티는 플랫폼과 디바이스가 통합되어 구성된 서비스로서 국내 스마트시티 생태계 육성을 위해서는 대기업의 플랫폼 기술과 다수의 디바이스 기술을 보유한 중소기업이 참여하는 수익공유 모델개발이 필요하다.
스마트도시법도 최근의 사회변화를 반영하는 것이라고 할 수 있으며, 4차 산업혁명 시대에 적극적으로 대응하기 위한 노력의 일부라 하겠다. 하지만, 기존의 법체계 관점에서는 스마트시대로의 변화과정이 기존의 체계를 저해하거나 형해화 하는 것처럼 인식되기도 한다. 역사적으로 도시의 기능은 끊임없이 변화해 왔다. 근대 이후의 도시가 가지고 있는 기능은 여러 가지로 표현될 수 있지만 경제, 사회, 문화 등 생활의 근거지로서의 중심지 이자 기반이 되는 기능은 변하지 않고 유지되고 있다. 여기에 도시민의 삶의 질 향상이 더 추가되고 있다.
법제도는 사회의 변화를 저지하는 것이 아니라 그 변화를 수용하고 이끌어 나가는 것이며 법의 역할도 그러하다. 사회적 변화를 반영한 법적 개선은 필요한 과정이다. 다만, 그 방향은 시민들의 삶의 안전과 복지를 위한 것이며, 그 범위 내에서 기존 법체계에 대한 적절한 변화가 필요한 것이다. 법과 제도의 개선 방향을 합리적으로 이해하고, 기존의 법체계와의 충돌문제를 얼마만큼 잘 조율ㆍ조정할 것인가, 새로운 현상에 대한 법적 공백을 어떻게 잘 메울 것인가도 중요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

산업의 집중도를 계산할 때 일반적으로 사용되는 허핀달지수(Hirschman-Herfindahl Index)를 이용하여 품목별 수출, 지역별 수출, 품목별 수입, 지역별 수입 등 4가지 측면의 집중도를 계산하였다. 허핀달지수 값이 높을수록 특정 품목(지역)으로 수출입이 집중되는것을 의미하며 허핀달지수 값이 낮아지면 특정 품목(지역) 수출입집중도가 완화됨을 의미한다.
(품목별 수출집중도) 최근 품목별 수출집중도가 통계가 제공되기 시작한 1977년 이래 최고 수준으로 급증하였다. 품목별 수출집중도는 2010년 1,204p로 크게 오른 이후 낮아지는 모습을 보였으나 2017년과 2018년 각각 1,218p 1,210p로 다시 급증하였다. 2010년의 수출집중도 상승은 선박의 수출 점유율 상승에 기인한다. 수출이 급증하던 조선업은 2010년 이후 침체를 겪으며 2012~2016년 동안 나타난 수출경기둔화에 일정부분 원인으로 작용하였다. 현재 수출의 반도체 의존도 급증은 향후 반도체 경기 둔화시 과거 조선업 사례와 유사한 수출 하방 압력으로 작용할 가능성이 크다.
(지역별 수출집중도) 중국, 베트남 지역으로의 수출 편중이 심화하며 지역별 수출집중도는 1991년 이후 최고치를 기록하고 있다. 1980년대 지역별 수출집중도는 1,931p까지 높아졌으나 다양한 수출 시장을 개척하려는 노력으로 집중도가 1998년에는 615p까지 떨어졌다. 최근 중국, 베트남 지역의 경제성장과 글로벌가치사슬 거점부상으로 이들 지역에 수출이 몰리며 지역별 수출집중도가 1,018p로 늘어났다.
(품목별 수입집중도) 2016년까지 낮아지던 품목별 수입집중도가 최근 다시 높아지고 있다. 품목별 수입집중도는 2012년 1,514p까지 높아진 이후 2016년 799p까지 낮아졌으나 2018년 다시 1,007p까지 상승하였다. 이러한 현상은 우리나라의 높은 원유수입의존도에 기인한다. 과거부터 품목별 수입집중도는 국제유가 변동과 유사하게 움직이고 있다. 수입 구조 측면에서 여전히 국제 유가 움직임에 취약한 모습이 관찰되고 있다.
(지역별 수입집중도) 지역별 수입집중도는 낮아지고 있다. 2000년대 초 국내 수입액 중 약 44%를 차지하였던 일본, 미국, 사우디 등 지역의 수입 비중은 지속해서 낮아지며 2018년 26.3%까지 감소하였다. 칠레를 시작으로 ASEAN, 인도, 베트남 등 지역과 FTA 체결로 수입국이 다변화하며 특정 지역으로부터 수입 쏠림 현상이 완화하였다. 수입 품목이 원자재로 편중되는 현상은 여전하나 원자재 수급의 안정적 확보를 위한 수입지역 다변화 노력은 성과를 보였다.
·수출입집중도가 국내 경제에 미치는 영향
최근 수출입집중도 추이를 살펴보았을 때 국내 경제의 우려되는 점은 첫째, 수출집중도가 높아질 경우 국내 경제는 경제성장률의 변동성이 커진다. 일반적으로 무역의존도가 높고 수출 다변화가 이루어지지 못한 나라일수록 경제의 호황과 불황의 진폭이 크다. 우리나라의 무역의존도는 68.8%로 주요국 대비 높고 최근 수출집중도 역시 높아지고 있다. 글로벌 수요가 감소할 경우 국내 경제는 다른 나라들보다 부정적 영향을 더 크게 받을 것이다. 둘째, 현재와 같이 수출이 일부 품목에 지나치게 의존한다면 향후 특정 산업의 경기 사이클에 전체 수출의 방향성이 좌우될 것이다. 반도체의 경우 아직 수출이 증가세를 유지하고 있지만 IT 상승 사이클이 꺾이고 중국의 본격적인 생산량 확대가 이루어질 경우 국내 수출이 크게 영향을 받을 것이다. 셋째, 집중된 수출구조로 인해 기업 간 격차가 확대될 수 있다. 국내 수출 상위 품목들인 반도체, 조선업, 자동차 등은 높은 진입장벽과 자본집약적 산업으로 중소기업이 신규 진입하여 부가가치를 창출하기 어렵다. 실제 수출집중도가 급증한 2017년에 전체 수출 중 대기업이 차지하는 비중은 65.5%로 2016년 62.2% 보다 3.3%p 급증하였다. 넷째, 현재 이슈가 되고 있는 미-중 간 무역전쟁 문제에 취약해진다. 우리나라는 미국, 중국 등 일부 시장에 편중된 수출로 되어 있다. 향후 미국과 중국의 무역갈등이 격화할 경우 국내 수출의 큰 위협요인으로 작용할 우려가 있다. 다섯째, 여전히 높은 원유에 대한 수입집중도는 최근과 같이 국제유가가 크게 오를 경우 공급측 충격을 통해 국내 경제에 부정적 요인으로 작용한다. 국제 유가 상승은 소비, 투자 등에 부정적 영향을 미쳐 경제성장률 및 국민소득에 악영향을 미칠 것이다.
·시사점
수출입집중도 상승 시 나타나는 현상이 국내 경제 리스크로 확산하는 것을 막기 위해서는 첫째, 경제의 안정성을 높이기 위해 수출 품목의 다변화를 지속해서 추진해야 한다. 둘째, 수출점유율이 높은 품목에 대해 수요 변화 예측을 위한 모니터링을 강화해야 한다. 셋째, 신흥시장 및 신산업 발굴 노력을 지속해야 한다. 넷째, 대기업과 중소기업의 복합 경쟁력 제고를 통한 동반 수출 확대 전략이 필요하다. 다섯째, 국제유가 상승으로 인한 국내 경제의 충격에 대비해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Personal Mobility. PM)이 자동차 중심의 교통문제를 해소하면서 지속가능한 교통수단이라는 장점으로 이용자가 지속적으로 증가하고 있다.  수요측면에서도 2014년 기준 약 3,500대의 이용대수에서 2022년에는 20만대를 넘어설 것으로 예상되고 있다. 하지만 아직까지 개인형 이동수단 관련 법적 규제와 이용가능한 도로, 안전기준 등이 규정되지 않아 이용자들은 차도 뿐만 아니라 보도에서도 이용하면서 각종 안전사고가 발생되고 있다. 이러한 사회적 문제에 따라 본 연구에서는 개인형 이동수단의 안전한 이용을 위해 도로 환경디자인에 대한 제도적·물리적 조성방안을 제시하고자 한다. (연구방법) 이에 본 연구에서는  개인형 이동수단의 개념 및 특징, 이용현황을 우선 살펴보고, 선진사례 분석을 통해 연구의 기초를 마련하였다. 연구의 대상으로 개인형 이동수단의 범위는 저/중속의 1인용 교통수단 기기를 대상으로 하였고, 제도적·물리적 이용환경 기준을 범위로 설정하였다. 연구방법으로는 우선, 국내의 개인형 이동수단 관련 제도적 현황 및 향후 이용가능성이 높은 자전거도로의 주요환경요소에 대한 현황을 파악하였다. 이후, 선진사례 연구를 통해 제도적 측면에서는 주행가능 공간 및 이용규칙 등을 살펴보았으며, 물리적 측면에서는 주요 주행가능도로인 자전거도로를 대상으로 주요 시설요소의 현황 분석을 통해 국내에 도입가능한 요소들을 도출하였다.

2019,"3·1운동기 서울의 독립선언과 만세시위의 재구성 -3월 1일과 5일을 중심으로- = Declaration and Demonstration for Independence in Seoul on March 1 and 5, 1919","March 1st Movement,Seoul,Taehwagwan Restaurant,Pagoda Park,Declaration for Independence,students’ Demonstration for Independence,3·1운동,서울,태화관,파고다공원,독립선언,학생시위","3월 1일 오후 2시 태화관에서 있었던 ‘민족대표’의 독립선언식은 ‘선언서 배부 → 종로경찰서에 인력거군을 통하여 선언서 전달 → 점심식사 → 경찰의 태화관 출동 → 한용운의 연설 → 조선독립만세 삼창 → 자동차로 경무총감부로 연행’ 등의 순서로 진행되었다.
같은 시각 파고다공원에서 있었던 선언식에는 주로 중등학교 학생들과 일부 전문학교 학생들이 참여했다. 당일 오후 2시경에 서울에 뿌려진 독립선언문의 배포도 주로 중등학교 학생들이 맡았다. 파고다공원의 독립선언식도 ‘독립선언문의 배포와 낭독’와 ‘독립만세’의 순으로 진행되었다. 이러한 운동 방식은 이미 천도교측의 최린과 기독교측의 함태영 사이에 합의된 것이었다.
파고다공원에서 나온 학생들은 시민들을 ‘독립만세’ 행진에 끌어들였고, 시위대의 수는 순식간에 수천 명으로 늘어났다. 3월 1일 학생들의 시가지 시위행진은 오후 5시경까지 일제 경찰의 별다른 저지를 받지 않고 진행되었다. 당시 경찰은 민족대표 29인을 태화관에서 경무총감부로 이송하는 데 집중하고 있었고, 시위대를 막는 일에는 본격적으로 나서지 못했다.
시위대는 크게 3대로 나뉘어 시가지를 행진했으며, 서대문, 덕수궁 대한문 앞, 프랑스영사관, 미국영사관 앞, 창덕궁, 광화문 등을 주로 돌았다. 시위대는 미국과 프랑스 영사관에 한국인들의 독립의지를 전달하려 했다. 4시 이후 여러 시위대의 최종 집결한 곳은 남산 밑의 일본인들의 거리였던 혼마치거리(本町通)였다. 당시 시위대는 최종 목적지를 남산에 있는 조선총독부로 설정하고 있었던 것으로 보인다. 이에 총독부는 용산의 조선군(조선 주둔 일본군) 사령부에 병력 출동을 요청하여, 보병 3개 중대와 기병 1개 소개가 출동, 혼마치거리에 진을 쳤다. 경찰도 이곳에 저지선을 펴고 시위대를 막았으며, 5시경부터는 시위대를 강제 해산시키고 검거하기 시작하였다.
3월 5일에는 전문학교 학생들이 중심이 되고, 중등학교 학생들이 참여한 시위가 남대문역 앞에서 오전 9시부터 시작되었다. 수천 명의 학생들이 참여한 이 시위에서 김원벽과 강기덕은 인력거 위에 올라서서 ‘조선독립’이라는 깃발을 들었고, 학생들은 ‘독립만세’를 외치면서 남대문 방향으로 행진했다. 경찰은 남대문에 저지선을 펴고 강력한 진압으로 나왔지만, 학생들은 저지선을 뚫고 둘로 나뉘어 대한문, 조선은행－종로 방면으로 진출하며 만세를 불렀다. 일제 군경은 대한문 앞과 조선은행 앞에 2차 저지선을 펴고 시위대를 해산시켰으며, 이곳에서 많은 학생들을 체포하였다. 시위에 참여한 학생들은 자신들의 이 시위가 파리강화회의에서 조선의 독립문제가 논의될 수 있는 계기가 될 것이라고 기대했다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그렇다면 외국인들이 바라보는 ‘대한민국’은 어떤 나라일까? 중국은 문화대혁명 때 孔子를 버렸고, 모택동은 批林批孔運動을 펼치며 儒敎를 처절하게 비판했다. 반면에, 우리나라는 600년이라는 전례없는 長壽王朝를 탄생시켰는데, 그 왕조는 곧 ‘선비’가 통치한 나라였다. 그러면 과연, 우리나라가 추구하는 이상형의 인간상은 ‘선비’라고 확신할 수 있을까? 또 외국인들은 대한민국을 ‘선비’가 살아있는 ‘東方禮儀之國’이라고 평가할까? 우리는 산업화를 거치면서 눈부신 富의 축적과 경제적 성장을 이루었을지는 몰라도, 도덕적 타락과 정신적 해이라는 부정적 이면을 가지게 되었다. 否認할 수 없는 사실일 것이다. 그렇다고 하여 여기에서 부끄러워할 수 없고, 고개를 숙일 필요는 더더욱 없다. 우리는 수많은 고비를 겪으면서도 반만년 역사를 면면히 이어왔다. 그리고 우리가 그렇게 버틸 수 있었던 힘은 憂患意識 속에서도 마음 속 깊이 가지고 있었던 ‘정신문화에 대한 자부심’이 있었기 때문에 가능했다. 先代로부터 내려온 ‘선비정신’이 동력源이었고, 에너지였다. 단군이래로부터 일제강점기에 이르기까지, 우리들에겐 단 한 순간도 내던지지 않았던 민족정신이 있었다. 그것은 사장되지 않고 생명처럼 이어온 ‘부드러우면서도 강인한 內柔外剛의 선비정신’이었다.
그런데 지금은 제4차 혁명과 기술과학의 발달이 인공지능[AI]을 등장시키고 있다. 이러한 때야말로 全세계인들은 ‘보다 더 인간 냄새가 풍기는 인간적인 모습’에 갈망한다. 실로 ‘유교의 선비정신’이 요구되는 시기이며, 이 정신은 서구가 말하는 Humanity에 가장 근접한 코드이고, 21세기 이후 인간의 가치를 드높일 수 있는 저점이기도 하다.
그렇다고 하여 이 글이 “우리 것이야말로 좋은 것이다.”라는 슬로건이나 명제를 내세우고자 작성된 것은 결코 아니다. 아무리 우리 고유의 것이라 할지라도, 비판받아 마땅한 것은 당연히 겸허한 자세로 성찰해야만 한다. 하지만 이 글은 그간 선대로부터 이어온 올곧은 선비정신의 실재가 존재했었음을 역사적 사례로 실증해냄으로써, 후속세대들에게 무한한 자존심을 가지고 기억해달라는 최소한의 간절함에 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,카풀과 보험제도에 대한 연구 = A Study on Car Pool and Insurance System,"Platform Transport Company,Car Pool,Insurance,Sharing                     Economy,Ride Sharing,플랫폼운송기업,카풀,보험,공유경제,승차공유","카풀은 플랫폼을 기반으로 한 모빌리티 서비스를 통하여 출퇴근 이동시 원하는 운전자와 이용객이 자가용 자동차로 함께 이동하는 공유 서비스를 말한다. 카풀 이용자가 스마트 폰앱을 통하여 원하는 목적지를 입력하면 미리 등록된 차량의 출퇴근 경로를 파악해 가까운 운전자를 연결해준다. 4차 산업혁명과 공유경제에 부합하는 시스템이라 할 수 있다. 우리나라의 카풀은 출퇴근 시간에 한정하여 자가용 승용차를 유상으로 운송해주는 라이드 세어링(Ride Sharing)이라 할 수 있다. 2016년 4월 창업한 스타트 업체인 풀러스와 이번에 문제가 된 카카오 모빌리티가 대표적이다.
플랫폼운송기업에 의한 카풀 여객운송이 문제가 되는 것은 그 규모성과 자본력 그리고 기술성에 기인한다. 이는 이전 여객운송의 영토를 바꿀 수 있는 엄청난 변화를 예견하고 있다. 현재 우리나라에서 벌어지고 있는 카풀 논쟁은 플랫폼 서비스의 일부에 불과하다.
카풀은 출퇴근 시에 방향이 같은 사람을 태워주고 경비를 받는다. 카풀의 경비는 택시보다 20~30%정도 낮다. 수익은 운전자가 80%를 가지고, 플랫폼기업이 20%의 수수료를 가지는 구조이다. 하지만 수익을 목적으로 한 이러한 운영형태는 일종의 유사택시서비스라 할 수 있다. 자가용을 이용하여 유상운송을 할 경우에는 택시운송업계와의 마찰뿐만 아니라 보험문제가 야기될 수 있다.
자가용을 이용한 유상운송은 보험면책 사항에 해당 한다. 카풀은 자가용으로 유상운송을 하는 형태이지만 불법은 아니다. 현행 운수사업법은 자가용의 유상운송을 제한하고 있지만, 출퇴근 시 자가용 승용차를 함께 타는 카풀의 경우는 예외로 허용하고 있다. 그렇지만 유상운송에 대한 논란이 분분하다. 또한 카풀의 보험범위를 어떻게 볼 것인지도 문제이다. 운수사업법은 카풀의 범위를 출퇴근 시간인 오전 7~9시와 오후 6~8시로 규정하였다. 그러나 보험 적용 범위를 로그 온 시부터인지, 이용자가 탑승할 시인지, 탑승한 시기부터 어느 정도 지날 때까지를 운행 중으로 볼 것인지에 대한 명확한 기준이 없다.
플랫폼운송기업은 카풀 서비스에 대하여 중개역할만을 하기 때문에 보험책임을 지지 않는다고 한다. 실제로 카풀에 대한 보험책임은 자가용 운전자가 진다. 그런데 자가용 승용차의 유상운송은 보험사가 책임을 지지 않는다. 이는 보험사고시 플랫폼운송기업과 자가용운전자 사이의 보험책임공백이 발생할 수 있다. 또한 카풀 이용시 직업성과 운행방향성도 문제가 될 수 있다.
혁신적인 기술에 의한 새로운 시스템의 도입은 기존의 법제도와 충돌할 수 있다. 기술의 발전에 따른 혁신이 저해되지 않도록 새로운 규제체계를 마련할 필요가 있다. 본 논문에서는 카풀보험의 범위에 대한 내용을 중심으로 살펴보도록 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

방염기능성 텍스타일은 기능적으로, 심미적으로 급격히 발전하고 있는데, 특히 본 연구에서는 독일, 아일랜드, 미국, 인도, 그리고 우리 나라의 방염원단에 대하여 알아보았다. 이 과정을 통해서 현재 세계적 방염기능성 텍스타일의 디자인이 재질과 색상 개발 면에서 괄목할만한 성과를 거두고 있다는 것을 알 수 있었다. 또한 이러한 텍스타일 디자인의 발달은 제품 디자인에 적용함으로써 활용 가치를 인정받게 되는데, 본 연구는 현재 방염기능성 텍스타일을 소재로 하여 제작되는 제품들을 가방류, 선박 및 자동차류, 소파 등의 인테리어 제품류로 나누어 살펴보았다. 그리고 이를 바탕으로 우리 나라의 방염원단 활용 제품들로 아웃도어 의류와 전기회사 작업복을 고찰하고 향후 나아갈 방향을 제시하였다. 
본 연구의 제언은 크게 세 가지로 볼 수 있다. 첫째는 방염기능성 텍스타일이 더욱 대중적으로 사용되기 위해서 필수불가결한 전제조건이 바로 대량생산과 그로 인한 원가절감이라는 점이다. 둘째는 방염제도 기준 강화에 대한 필요성이고, 셋째는 방염기능성 텍스타일 디자인 능력 향상에 대한 요구이다. 방염이라는 반드시 필요한 기능과 그 기능이 강화되면서도 디자인적 활용가치를 추구하는 목적의 본 연구가 현 시점에 실효성있는 정책 수립을 위하여 유의미할 것이라 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,1960년대 농촌 여가문화의 특성과 의미 - 대천일기를 사례로 = Characteristics and Meanings of Rural Leisure Culture in the 1960s- Through the Case of Daecheon Diary,"여가,농촌마을,대천일기,근대화,공동체,Leisure,Rural Villages,Daecheon Diary,Modernization,Community","본 연구는 윤희수의 『대천일기』를 사례로 1960년대 근대화 과정에 나타난 농촌마을의 여가문화를 다면적 측면에서 살펴보고 그 특성과 의미를 고찰하고자 한다.
세시풍속과 관련한 여가문화의 경우, 개인은 휴식뿐만 아니라 가정의 건강과 안녕을 추구하였고 특히 농사일과 가사, 육아노동에 지친 여성들에게 여가는 힘든 노동의 공간을 벗어날 수 있는 기회이기도 했다. 그리고 집단적 여가문화인 봄놀이, 해치, 걸립을 통해 공동체의식을 강화하는 여가의 기능이 전승되고 있었다. 일상에서는 음주, 화투놀이와 같은 일탈의 여가활동을 행하기도 했지만 낮잠, 교제·만남, 신문읽기, 독서 등과 같은 여가활동은 휴식, 재충전, 친목 도모 그리고 때로는 정보 습득, 자기 계발을 위한 시간이었다.
1960년대 중반 이후 대중매체의 보급과 발전으로 텔레비전 시청, 라디오 청취, 직접적인 영화감상 등의 여가활동이 이루어졌으며 이는 정보 제공뿐만 아니라 새로운 문화를 접하는 계기가 되었다. 또한 여름휴가제 도입과 확산, 자동차·버스와 같은 교통수단의 발달 등의 영향으로 마을 물놀이 계층의 다양화, 해수욕장에서의 피서와 같은 변화가 생겨났다. 마을 주변에서 행해지던 봄놀이는 상업화된 관광으로 확대되어 관광 횟수의 증가뿐만 아니라 주체, 대상, 목적, 관광지 등도 더욱 대중화, 다양화 되었다. 하지만 개인·가족 단위가 아니라 공동체 연대를 증진시키기 위한 단체, 마을 단위의 관광이 대부분이었다.
1960년대 농촌마을에서 전근대와 근대의 여가문화가 공존하고 있었으나 여전히 여가는 농사일의 일부라는 인식이 남아 있었다. 근대화, 도시화가 빠르게 진행되고 있었지만 대천마을 사람들은 여전히 농업에 기반을 둔 삶을 살아가고 있었고 마을 역시 전통적 공동체, 동성마을로서 존재하고 있었기 때문이었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,시대 변화에 따른 영화영상의 페이스에 대한 고찰 = A Study on the Pace of Film according to the Change of Time Period,"pace,video editing,<The Fast and the Furious>,속도감,영상편집,<분노의 질주>","마치 속도 경쟁이라도 벌이듯 ‘더 빠르게’는 오늘날 모든 면에서 화두가 된 지 오래다. 현대 사회의 빠른 속도에 익숙해져 버린 우리는 이제 잠시의 기다림에도 조바심으로 짜증이 날 지경이다. 이렇게 점점 더 빠른세상은 기술의 비약적인 발전으로 가능했다. 개인용 컴퓨터는 잠시의 휴식도 허락하지 않을 정도로 빨라졌으며 특히 금세기 최고의 발명품인 스마트폰으로 시공간의 제약 없이 많은 일들을 처리하고 다양한 콘텐츠와 서비스를 소비할 수 있게 되었다. 속도 경쟁의 사회에서 소비되는 영상 콘텐츠의 속도감도 시대의 흐름에 따라 변하였고 빠른속도감을 선호하는 관객들의 요구에 의해 발전해온 것이다. 본 연구에서는 영화영상의 페이스가 시대의 흐름에 따라 어떻게 변모해왔는지를 17년 동안 시리즈로 제작되어온 <분노의 질주>의 편집을 계량적 방법으로 측정하여17년간의 변화 추이를 분석하였다. 그 결과 숏 밀도의 부분 상승과 하락은 있으나 전체적으로는 상승 구조에 있으며 평균 ASL은 점차 짧아져 왔음을 확인하였다. 또한 최고와 최저 숏 밀도의 차이가 <분노의 질주> 4편 이후에매우 커진 것을 확인할 수 있었고, 이 점으로 미루어보아 현대의 영상편집에서 숏 밀도의 대비를 활용하여 영상의리듬을 형성하고 있다는 것을 확인 할 수 있었다. 숏 밀도의 최고점은 높은 긴장감을 형성해야 하는 자동차 질주나액션장면에서 관찰되었으며 최저 숏 밀도는 주로 대화 장면과 같은 정적이거나 서정적인 장면에서 관찰되었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이 시기 서울은 급격한 인구증가와 도시문제의 해결이 필요한 상황이었다. 1966년 부임한 김시장은 ‘서울의 교통난 완화’를 첫 공약으로 내세웠고, 이를 위해 적자사업이었던 한국전력(주)의 전차사업을 과감히 인수하였다. 이는 도심개발에 의한 것이었지만, 장기적으로는 도심에 한정된 전차교통을 서울의 확장에 맞추어 버스교통으로 대체하는 작업이었다.
이에 따라 1967년 서울시는 ‘건설 돌진의 해’라는 구호와 함께 변두리 개발을 시정목표로 삼았다. 시 외곽지역에는 도심 개발로 이주해 온 철거민들의 정착지가 형성되어 있었다. 이들에게는 가구당 8~12평 남짓한 토지가 주어졌고 일부는 자신의 토지를 전매한 후 도심으로 회귀하였다. 이러한 상황 속에 서울시는 철거민들이 도심으로 돌아오지 않도록 교통편을 마련해야 했다. 하지만 ‘황금노선’만 찾는 민간 운수업체에게 이를 기대하기는 어려운 상황이었다. 결국 서울시는 ‘수도교통의 종합적 대책 수립’과 ‘대시민서비스 위주의 교통체계’라는 미명 하에 버스사업을 시작하게 된다. 더욱이 시영버스는 전차철거 이후 종업원들의 대책마련을 위한 것이기도 했다. 서울시는 자동차 운전면허를 취득한 전차종업원을 최대한 버스사업에 수용하였다.
이러한 시영버스는 시 경계지역의 이주정착지를 종점으로 운행하였다. 버스노선은 모두 6개였으며, 이 중에서 상계동을 제외한 지역이 모두 한강 이남에 분포한다는 사실이 주목된다. 당시 서울은 한강 이남의 넓은 지역까지 확대되었으나, 시영버스가 개통된 시점에 한강 교량은 단지 3개(한강대교, 광진교, 양화대교) 뿐이었다. 이처럼 시영버스의 운행은 장거리에 우회구간이 추가되면서 멀고 험난한 여정이 되었다.
지금까지 살펴본 시영버스는 서울의 신편입지역까지 운행한 최초의 대중교통이었다. 서울시는 이주정착지에 거주하는 주민들의 도심 이동과 전차 철거라는 시대적 과업을 안고 버스사업을 시작하였다. 결국 시영버스는 새롭게 서울이 된 시 경계지역까지 하나의 생활권으로 연결하는 역할을 하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'가습기살균제 사망사건'이 일어난 지 약 5년 만에 책임을 회피해오던 옥시레킷벤키저가 2016년 5월 22일 사과를 했지만, 당시 검찰 수사가 시작되자 어쩔 수 없이 했다는 평가이다. 이런 행동을 보인 건 옥시뿐만이 아니다. 문제를 일으킨 글로벌 기업 중 한국 소비자에게 제대로 사과를 하고 책임을 진 곳은 찾아보기 힘들다. 또 다른 대표적인 예로는 자동차 업체인 폭스바겐사건을 들 수 있다. 폭스바겐은 경유차 배출가스 저감장치 조작사건(이른바 폭스바겐 배출가스 조작스캔들(Volkswagen emissions scandal))으로 세계적인 비난을 받았다. 폭스바겐은 미국에서 3건의 화해에서 도합 155억 3,300만달러의 지급이 결정되었고, 비리 관련 기술자에게는 3년 4개월의 금고형이 부과되었다. EU에서도 손해배상을 요구하는 집단소송이 제기되었다. 그런데 우리나라에서는 폭스바겐의 경우에도 특별한 손해배상이나 리콜조치 등이 이루어지고 있지 않다. 이는 우리나라의 입법의 미비에 기인한 것이다.
집단소송과 관련된 제도 중에서 우리나라에 필요한 제도들을 적정하게 도입할 필요가 있다. 적어도 소액 다수의 피해자를 사법상 구제함에 있어서 선정당사자 제도의 한계 및 소비자기본법상의 집단분쟁조정제도와 단체소송이 갖는 한계가 분명한 이상, 집단소송제도를 도입하지 않으면 안 된다.
독일법상 단체소송은 다수의 피해자가 손해의 배상을 절실히 원함에도 불구하고 선정당사자 등을 선출하는 데 어려움을 겪을 경우, 어차피 손해배상청구를 할 수 없는 만큼, 사안을 해결하는 데 한계가 있을 수밖에 없다. 또한 독일의 시범확인소송은 피해자의 적극적 소송참여를 전제로 하는 것이므로, 소액 다수 피해사례에서는 큰 의미를 가질 수 없을 것이다.
소액 다수의 피해자를 사법상 구제를 위한 합리적인 대안으로는 미국의 집단소송제도인 class action과 일본의 2단계 집단소송제도를 그 대안으로서 생각할 수 있다. 소비자의 이익보호에 방점을 두는 경우에는 미국식의 집단소송(이른바 opt out형 집단소송)을 도입하면서 즉, 피해자가 누구라도 전체 피해자집단의 이익을 보호하기 위한 집단소송을 제기할 수 있도록 하고, 특별히 이 집단소송에서 제외를 신청하지 않는 한 집단소송의 결과에 구속되며, 피해구제를 받을 수 있도록 하는 것이 바람직해 보인다.
또한, 어느 누구도 직접 소송에 나서고자 하지 않는 일정한 소액 피해의 경우 자격 있는 소비자단체 등에게 집단소송을 제기할 수 있는 원고적격을 부여하는 것도 하나의 대안이라고 생각된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이에 선수가 운동에 더 집중할 수 있도록 선수를 대신하여 업무를 처리할 자가 요구되는 바, 이를 선수 에이전트라고 한다. 그러나 다수의 선수는 경제적 부담 등 여러 이유로 인하여 에이전트제도의 혜택을 받지 못함으로써 소수의 고액연봉인 선수들과의 차이가 생겨난다. 본 연구에서는 다수의 선수도 에이전트제도의 혜택을 받을 수 있도록 에이전트의 업무를 수행할 수 있는 스마트에이전트에 대하여 살펴보았다. 
스마트에이전트란 인공지능과 에이전트의 합성어로써 빅데이터, 머신러닝 및 딥러닝을 기반으로 프로그래밍 된 알고리즘으로 구현한 인공지능 기술을 의미한다. 인공지능은 사람과 사물, 사물과 사물이 인터넷 통신망으로 연결되어 있으며 이러한 초연결성으로 비롯된 막대한 데이터를 분석하여 일정한 패턴을 파악하고, 이러한 분석 결과를 토대로 인간의 행동을 예측하는 일련의 단계를 통해 새로운 가치를 창출할 수 있는 특징을 갖고 있다. 인공지능 기술은 IT 산업뿐만 아니라 의료, 농업, 자동차 및 금융이나 법률 등 지식 서비스 분야에서 이미 활용되고 있다. 
스마트에이전트는 빅데이터, 머신러닝 및 딥러닝 기술을 활용하여 기존 휴먼에이전트가 주로 수행하였던 계약과 관련된 업무뿐만 아니라 일정관리, 마케팅 활동 등 매니전트 분야까지 휴먼보다 스마트하게 업무를 수행할 수 있을 것이다. 스마트에이전트의 활용으로 인하여 소수의 스타 선수뿐만 아니라 다수의 선수도 적은 비용으로 높은 효율성을 자랑하는 스마트에이전트를 활용함으로써 에이전트제도의 혜택을 받을 수 있을 것이다. 이는 에이전트제도의 목적인 선수의 권익 보호에 이바지함으로써 궁극적으로는 스포츠 산업의 발달에 영향을 줄 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그런데 법적 삼단논법은 그 중요성과 기능에도 불구하고, 법 실증주의나 법 형식주의와 결합되어 있기 때문에, 특히나 법현실주의나 법해석학의 비판을 받고 있다고 생각된다. 이에 본고에서는 법 실증주의에 기초한 논리적, 기계적, 고정적 삼단논법이나 법해석학의 삼단논법 회의론을 비판적으로 살펴본 후, 법적 삼단논법의 의미와 위치, 기능을 사회변화의 관점에서 검토해 보고자 한다.
본고가 주장하는 동적, 패러다임적 삼단논법에 의하면, 어떠한 법규범이 지배적 패러다임이 되면 지배적 패러다임을 적용하여 많은 통상적 사례들을 해결한다는 것이다. 하지만 이러한 과정에서 기존의 패러다임으로 해결하기 어려운 이상사례가 등장하고 누적되면, 기존 법 패러다임에 위기가 오고, 그 결과 대안적 패러다임이 등장하여 서로 경쟁하다가 결국 새로운 패러다임으로 교체된다는 것이다.
본고에서는 이러한 이론을 입증하기 위하여 몇 가지 사례를 살펴본다. 먼저 성전환자에 대한 강간죄의 성립여부와 관련하여, 본래 통상적으로는 전통적인 여성, 부녀가 강간죄의 객체였지만, 성전환수술의 발전으로 성전환자가 상당수 등장하게 되었고, 이는 기존의 지배적 패러다임에 대한 이상사례로 작용하게 된 것이다. 결국 성전환자도 강간죄의 대상으로 보는 새로운 패러다임이 승리하였고, 형법의 개정으로까지 귀결되었다. 기계적 복사문서가 문서위조, 변조죄의 객체가 되는가 하는 문제도 마찬가지이다. 자동차를 이용하여 사람을 폭행한 경우, 특수폭행죄의 구성요건인 “위험한 물건을 휴대”한 것에 해당되는지에 관한 판례도 같은 관점에서 이해할 수 있다.
결론적으로 본고는 어떠한 법규범 또는 개별 법조문 그 자체나 그에 대한 지배적 해석은 법적 패러다임이므로, 패러다임의 변화라는 역사적, 동적인 관점에서 법규범의 변화를 이해할 수 있다고 본다. 이러한 본고의 관점은 종래의 고정적 삼단논법과 대비하여 패러다임적, 동적 삼단논법이라고 할 수 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,준설선의 등기등록 및 저당권설정에 대한 연구 = A Study on the Registration and Mortgage Setting of Dredger Ships,"Dredger Ship,Construction Machinery,Ship Act,Construction Machinery Management Act,Registration and Signing up of Ships,준설선,건설기계,선박법,건설기계관리법,선박의 등기 및 등록","이 논문은 해저면의 토사물 등을 처리하기 위하여 수상에서 작업하는 준설선의 권리관계를 검토한 것이다. 준설선은 주로 수상에서 작업해야 하는 관계로 선박의 형태를 취하고 있다. 선박법에 따르면 소유자는 선박등기법에 따라 등기를 한 후에 선박등록을 신청하도록 하고 있다. 선박은 동산이지만 일반적인 동산의 물권변동과는 달리 등기 또는 등록을 해야지만 제3자에 대하여 대항력이 발생하기 때문이다. 또한, 선박은 고가의 물건이므로 선박등기법에 따른 저당권의 설정 등을 통하여 자본조달의 편의성을 지원하고 있다. 그러나 2007년 선박법 개정으로 인하여 건설기계관리법에 따라 건설기계로 등록된 준설선은 선박법 및 선박등기법에 따른 적용에서 제외되고 있다. 준설선은 선박의 형태를 갖추고 있어 기본적으로 선박법의 적용을 받도록 하고 있으나 실질적인 목적은 수상에서의 토사물 제거라는 작업이므로 건설기계로 분류될 수 있음을 감안한 조치이다. 따라서 건설기계관리법에 따라 등록하고 자동차 등 특정동산 저당법에 따라 저당권을 설정할 수 있도록 하고 있다. 그러나 건설기계관리법에 따르면 준설선의 물권변동에 대해서는 언급이 없다. 소유자는 등록하도록 하고 있지만, 운행을 위한 요건이지 권리관계를 위한 요건은 아니다. 동산과 같이 점유의 이전만으로 해결할 수 있는 사안은 아니다. 또한, 선박의 형태를 하고 있지만, 건설장비가 탑재된 시설이므로 저당권의 범위가 선박과 건설장비가 별도로 분리되어 처리되어야 하는지도 의문이다. 종물은 주물의 처분에 따르게 되어 있는데 건설장비를 종물로 볼 수 있을지 모호하다. 이 논문은 준설선의 물권변동과 저당권의 효력이 미치는 목적물의 범위에 대하여 살펴보고, 대법원 판례를 통하여 이를 검토해보고자 하는 데 의의가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,괴수 ‘불가사리’의 이미지 변주와 미디어 횡단성 = Image Variation and Transmediality of ‘Bulgasari’ Monster,"괴수,불가사리,이미지,변주,미디어 횡단성,Monster,‘Bulgasari’,Image,Variation,Transmediality","기이한 생김새의 생명체인 괴물(怪物, monster)은 이질적?비정상적?기형적 존재의낯선 ‘타자’로 우리의 삶과 일상을 위협하고 전복시킨다. 이러한 ‘괴물성(monstrosity)’ 은 공포와 함께 경외감을 낳기도 한다. 괴물은 괴상한 생김새로 다양하게 가시화돼 왔으며 특히, 거대한 크기는 ‘괴물성’을 보여주는 가장 강력하고 필수적인 요소이다. 괴물 중에서 괴이한 모양새의 짐승인 괴수(怪獸) 역시 오랜 시간동안 다양한 문화권에서여러 매체들을 통해 시각적?이야기이미지로 재현돼왔다. 한국의 경우, 여러 매체들에지속적으로 등장한 괴수는 불가사리이다. 특정 시기에 가공된 ‘토종형’ 내지 ‘한국형’ 괴수인 불가사리는 설화, 소설, 영화, 만화, 웹툰, 웹무비 등 다양한 매체들을 통해 이미지로 재현돼왔다. 이것은 언어매체, 시각매체, 영상매체, 디지털매체 등, 미디어(간) ‘번역’이자 ‘변형’이며 창조적 변환의 ‘각색’인 ‘미디어 횡단성’을 나타낸다. 따라서 본고는 괴수 불가사리의 시각적?이야기이미지의 변주에 따른 매체별 ‘괴물서사(monster narrative)’에 주목했고, ‘미디어 횡단성’으로 재현된 불가사리의 특징이 무엇인지 살펴보고자 했다.
먼저 시각적?이야기이미지의 근거가 될 불가사리의 원천이미지를 조선시대 문헌과 설화를 통해 알아봤다. 그 결과, 불가사리는 ‘미물(微物)의 우연한 등장’, ‘식철(食 鐵)’, ‘거대한 크기로 무한 성장’, ‘죽일 수 없음[不可殺]’ 등을 요소로 공동체를 위협하는 통제 불능의 파괴자 이미지였다. 이후 고전소설에서는 영웅을 돕는 조력자이자 문화영웅인 초자연적 중재자로, 마치 우직한 소처럼 시각화돼 신뢰적 이미지를 나타냈다. 반면, 1960년대 만화와 영화에서는 앙심을 품은 주인공의 복수를 돕거나 환생한주인공인 ‘언데드 괴물’, ‘인귀(人鬼)’로 복수의 이미지가 강했다. 따라서 그 시각적 이미지는 사납고 거칠게 표현됐다. 그런데 1980년대 북한영화의 불가사리는 압제에 대항하는 농민군을 돕는 혁명적 영웅이었으나, 혁명의 성공을 강조하기 위해 죽임을 당하는 존재로 그려졌다. 그 시각적 이미지는 <고지라>와 유사했지만, 농민군의 일원임을 나타내듯 황소처럼 뿔이 달리고, 어깨는 갑옷처럼 형상화됐다. 이에 비해, 최근 웹툰-웹무비의 ‘매체상호성’으로 묘사된 불가사리는 벌레의 이질적 탈바꿈을 강조한 ‘요수’의 이미지로 변형됐다. 자동차로 변신한 불가사리는 괴수물 특유의 긴장감, 스펙타클, 시각적 쾌감을 위해 철저히 파괴되는 대상으로 그려졌다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,2018년 하반기 경제전망,,"Ⅰ. 2018년 경제전망
1. 경제성장
▣ 2018년 우리나라 경제는 민간소비와 수출을 중심으로 2.9% 성장할 전망
·민간소비는 2/4분기에 성장 추세가 다소 약화되었으나 하반기에는 개별소비세인하, 아동수당 도입 등 정책 효과로 성장세를 회복할 것으로 전망됨.
·다만, 2017년 대폭 증가하였던 건설 및 설비투자가 뚜렷한 둔화세를 보이고 있음.
·국내 투자 수요의 둔화는 수입 위축으로 이어져 수출과 수입의 차이인 순수출의 GDP 성장에 대한 기여를 높일 것으로 전망됨.
▣ 2018년 민간소비 증가율은 2.8%를 기록할 전망
·2/4분기의 민간소비 증가율은 0.3%로 나타나 작년 2/4분기 이후 기록했던 높은 증가율을 이어가지 못함.
·하반기에는 신차 구입 시 부과되는 개별소비세 인하가 시행되어 내구재 소비회복에 기여할 전망
·9월부터 시행되는 아동수당 도입, 기초노령연금 인상도 소비 회복에 도움을 줄 전망
▣ 2018년 설비투자 증가율은 1.1%를 기록할 전망
·2017년에는 산업별로 경기가 차별화됨에 따라 제조업 가동률이 일부 저조한 상황에서도 설비투자 증가율은 14.6%로 높았음.
·올해도 반도체 등 일부 주력업종을 중심으로 전년과 비슷한 비교적 높은 규모의 설비투자가 이루어지겠지만 기저효과로 증가율은 낮을 전망
·최근 중국 등 후진국의 기술 추격으로 신규 국내 설비투자가 지연되는 현상이 나타나고 있는데, 이는 중장기적으로 설비투자 증가율에 영향을 미칠 것으로 판단됨.
▣ 2018년 건설투자 증가율은 주거용 건물의 신규 착공 감소와 함께 그 동안 지속되어 온 SOC 예산 축소 등의 영향으로 상당 폭 둔화된 △1.6%를 나타낼 것으로 전망
·2018년 분양물량 확대 및 주거용 건물의 신규착공 감소, 건설 투자 관련 선행지표의 증가율 하락 지속
·정부예산안 기준 2018년 정부의 SOC 투자는 2017년 대비 20% 가량 감소할 예정
2. 고용
▣ 2018년 중 취업자수는 전년대비 평균 17만명 증가하고 실업률도 3.9%를 기록하는 등 고용상황은 2017년에 비해 부진할 전망
·노동공급 측면에서 생산가능인구 증가폭이 추세적으로 줄어드는 가운데 노동수요도 건설업 둔화 등으로 약화되어 취업자수 증가폭이 2017년 32만명에 비해 축소
* 2018년 상반기 중 생산가능인구 증가폭은 15.5만명으로 2017년 19.7만명에 비해 4.2만명이 감소
·노동수요가 2017년에 비해 약화되는 가운데 공공ㆍ보육ㆍ요양 등의 분야에서 청년층을 중심으로 구직활동이 활발해지면서 노동공급이 늘어나서 실업률이 2017년에 비해 0.2%p 상승할 전망
3. 물가 및 시장금리
▣ 상반기 대비 하반기에는 물가상승 압력이 발생할 것으로 예상됨에 따라 2018년 소비자물가지수 상승률은 1.6%로 전망(상반기 1.4%, 하반기 1.8%)
·견고한 소비 성장세, 중동의 지정학적 리스크에 따른 유가 상승, 최근 달러화 강세와 맞물린 수입물가 상승 등은 우리나라 소비자물가 상승 압력으로 작용할 가능성
▣ 2018년 국고채(3년물) 금리는 미 연준 금리인상의 영향으로 전년대비 높은 수준을 나타낼 것으로 예상되며, 연평균 기준으로는 2.3%를 기록할 전망
·2017년 말부터 빠르게 상승했던 미 국채 금리 영향으로 우리나라 국고채 금리는 전년 대비 상당폭 높은 수준에 머물고 있음.
·다만, 한국은행 기준금리가 동결된 상태로 지속됨에 따라 올해 들어서는 한미 금리가 역전되었음에도 불구하고 시장금리 상승 속도가 상당히 완만한 상황
·하반기 금리 상승 속도는 한국은행의 기준금리 인상 여부와 미 연준의 금리 인상속도의 영향을 받을 것으로 예상되며, 이에 따라 변동성도 확대될 개연성이 있음.
4. 국제수지 및 원/달러 환율 전망
▣ 2018년 경상수지는 흑자 기조를 이어갈 것으로 예상되나, 흑자폭은 614억 달러로 2017년의 785억 달러에 비해 상당 수준 감소할 전망
·국제유가 상승에 대해 수입 물가가 수출 물가보다 탄력적으로 반응함에 따라 과거 국제유가 하락 시와는 반대 방향의 매커니즘이 작용하여 상품수지 흑자폭이 감소할 전망
·외국인의 증권투자에 대한 배당과 이자 지급이 증가하고, 원화 강세에 따른 외국인 근로자의 송금이 증가함에 따라 서비스ㆍ본원ㆍ이전소득수지는 전년대비 적자규모가 확대될 전망
▣ 2018년 통관기준 수출은 7.2% 증가, 수입은 11.0% 증가할 것으로 전망되며, 통관기준 무역수지는 835억 달러 흑자를 기록할 전망
·통관기준 수출은 국제유가 상승과 반도체 호조로 2018년 중에도 성장세를 이어가겠으나, 2016년의 기저효과로 인해 높은 성장률을 기록했던 2017년에 비해서는 성장률이 둔화되어 6,148억 달러를 기록할 전망
·통관기준 수입은 건설 및 설비투자 부진으로 증가세가 둔화되며 5,313억 달러를 기록할 전망
(원/달러 환율)
▣ 2018년 원/달러 연평균 환율은 전년에 비해 하락한 1,090원 수준이 될 것으로 전망·미국의 여타 주요국 대비 차별화된 경기회복 및 통화정책 정상화 속도, 신흥국 금융불안 등에 의한 안전자산 선호 등에 의해 글로벌 달러 강세가 당분간 지속될 전망
·또한 미ㆍ중 통상갈등이 심화됨에 따라 우리 경제에 미칠 여파에 대한 우려가 원/달러 환율에 대한 상방압력으로 작용할 것으로 보임.
·하지만 꾸준한 외국인 채권자금 유입 및 하반기 금통위 금리인상 가능성, 우리경제의 양호한 대외건전성 등을 감안할 때 최근의 신흥국 금융불안과 글로벌 불확실성 확대가 원/달러 환율의 급격한 상승으로 이어지지는 않을 전망
·또한 미ㆍ중 통상갈등의 타결 가능성과, 하반기 유로존 및 일본의 성장세 회복에 의한 글로벌 달러 약화 가능성 등이 상존하여, 작년말에서 연초까지 지속된 원/달러 환율의 하락을 고려할 때 연평균 환율은 전년대비 하락할 전망
Ⅱ. 종합평가 및 정책제언
1. 종합평가
▣ 2018년 세계경제는 미국을 중심으로 성장세를 지속할 것으로 보이나 국가별 성장속도의 불균형이 심화되고, 글로벌 무역분쟁의 심화와 정정 불안 등으로 하방 리스크가 확대될 것으로 IMF는 전망
·선진국은 전체적으로 잠재성장률을 상회하는 성장세가 예상되지만 유로존, 일본의 성장률이 4월 전망치보다 다소 낮아질 전망
·신흥국도 무역분쟁의 여파로 중국의 성장률이 소폭 낮아지는 등 주요 신흥국의 성장률이 다소 둔화될 전망
·세계 무역 증가율도 무역분쟁 장기화 등으로 4월 전망치보다 낮아질 전망
·미국 금리 인상, 무역분쟁, 정치불안 등으로 하반기 글로벌 성장세에 하방위험이 크지만 현재까지 공표된 실물지표만으로는 글로벌 성장세 둔화의 증거가 뚜렷하지 않음.
▣ 2018년 우리 경제는 글로벌 경제의 성장세 지속, 경제 활성화 정책 등에도 불구하고 무역분쟁 장기화, 투자 둔화 등으로 지난 전망치(3.1%, ‘18.5.1. 기준)보다 다소 낮은 2.9%의 성장률을 보일 전망
·상반기 중 설비투자 및 건설투자의 둔화세가 예상보다 가팔라진 반면 수출은 예상보다 다소 높은 성장세를 보였음.
·하반기에는 소비심리가 위축되고 있지만 개별소비세 감면, 아동수당 도입 등의 정책이 소비를 뒷받침할 것인 반면 수출은 무역분쟁 장기화 등으로 성장세가 다소 약화될 전망
▣ 올해 우리 경제의 성장률은 잠재성장률 수준을 유지하겠지만 대내외 불균형 확대와 구조적인 취약점으로 성장 동력이 약화되고 성장의 혜택이 확산되지 못하는 모습
·민간소비 증가율은 내구재, 해외여행 등을 중심으로 비교적 높게 유지되고 있지만 의류 및 신발 등 준내구재 소비, 음식숙박업의 부진으로 양극화가 심화됨에 따라 체감 소비경기는 미약
·ICT업종, 석유화학 등이 성장을 이끌고 있는 반면 자동차, 조선 등 일부 주력 제조업이 부진하여 동 업종과 관련이 높은 지역경제와 산업이 침체
·최근 수년간 빠르게 성장해 온 건설업의 둔화로 건설업 및 부동산업 종사자 및 기업의 경제활동 위축 전망
·자영업자는 음식숙박업 및 도소매업 업황 부진에 따른 매출 위축, 최저임금인상에 따른 비용 압박, 지방 주택시장 침체에 따른 담보가치 하락 등으로 부채상환능력 악화 우려
▣ 이와 함께 향후 1~2년 내에 경기 하강 위험이 가시화될 가능성에도 대비할 필요
·대외적으로 금융불균형이 누적되는 가운데 미국금리 급등, 무역분쟁 장기화, 중국경제 둔화 및 위안화 급락, 유럽 정치 불안 가능성 등이 주요 하방 위험요인으로 작용하여 시간이 경과함에 따라 글로벌 경기의 둔화 확률이 높아질 전망
* 국제금리가 상승하고 미국의 세제감면 효과가 줄어드는 가운데 무역분쟁까지 장기화되는 경우 향후 글로벌 성장모멘텀이 점차 약화될 전망
·대내적으로는 설비투자 및 건설투자 둔화, 가계부채 누적, 주력 산업의 경쟁력 정체, 경제 불균형의 확대 등이 우리경제의 활력을 둔화시키는 요인으로 작용할 가능성
* 대내적으로 올해의 급격한 건설투자 둔화가 내년까지 이어질 가능성이 높으며, 무역분쟁 장기화 등으로 투자심리가 위축된 가운데 주력업종의 설비투자도 더 큰 규모로 확대되기는 쉽지 않을 가능성
2. 정책제언
▣ 통화 및 재정정책은 향후 경기 둔화나 경제 불안이 현실화될 경우에 대비하여 우리경제의 복원력을 확충하는 방향으로 운용
·한편 대내외 불확실성이 크므로 금융시장에 대한 면밀한 모니터링과 철저한 외환건전성 관리가 필요
▣ 통화정책은 내외금리차, 가계부채 등에 따른 금융불균형 확대를 제한하기 위해 여건이 허락하는 범위 내에서 완화기조를 축소
·올해 중 소비자물가상승률이 정책 목표를 소폭 하회할 전망이어서 물가 측면에서 정책금리 인상을 서두를 필요성은 크지 않음.
·하지만, 가계부채가 여전히 가처분소득보다 빠르게 증가하고 있고 국내외 금리격차도 점차 커지고 있어서 금융안정을 위해서는 여전히 금리 인상의 필요성이 있음.
▣ 재정정책은 완화적 기조를 견지하는 가운데 중앙정부와 지자체가 협력하여 혁신성장과 포용성장 정책을 강화
·국민의 삶의 질을 개선하는 동시에 건설업이 민간부채 누적 등의 부작용을 야기하지 않으면서도 급격한 위축 없이 연착륙할 수 있는 방안으로 주거·교통·안전·환경 등 선진형 인프라투자를 확대하고 보건 및 사회복지 서비스를 대폭 확충
·선진형 인프라투자와 보건 및 사회복지 서비스 확충은 지역의 요구를 잘 반영하여야 투자의 효율성을 높일 수 있으므로 지방정부가 지역기업, 중앙정부와 협력하여 주도적으로 참여하는 방식으로 추진
·산업구조조정지역의 신규투자 유치를 위해서도 중앙정부와 지자체의 긴밀한 협력필요
▣ 경제양극화와 구조적인 문제의 심화로 경제성장의 혜택에서 소외된 취약계층 및 경제부문에 대해서는 미시적인 정책 대응이 필요
·사회보장의 확대와 관련해서는 국민 모두의 보편적 권리로 필요한 사항과 취약계층 보호를 위해 필요한 사항을 구분하여, 후자의 경우 정책대상을 지나치게 넓히기보다 선택과 집중을 통해 충분한 자원이 정책대상에 제공될 수 있도록 할 필요
▣ 혁신성장과 포용성장을 위해 필요한 과제인 노동시장 이중구조 및 경직성 완화와 사회안전망 강화를 사회적 합의 하에 패키지로 동시에 추진
·제4차 산업혁명 가속화, 후발신흥국의 추격, 글로벌 가치사슬 변화 등으로 인해 우리나라 기업의 원활한 사업재편 및 구조조정의 필요성이 커져가고 있으나 현재의 노동시장 구조와 사회안전망은 이를 뒷받침하기에 미흡
·기업의 원활한 사업재편을 통한 혁신적 성장을 위해 노동시장 유연성을 좀더 확대할 필요가 있으나 노동시장 유연성 확대는 사회안전망 강화라는 포용적 성장정책으로 보완되어야 노동자의 동의를 구할 수 있음.
·또한 사회안전망을 강화하는 데에는 세금이나 사회보험 부담의 확대가 수반될 수 밖에 없으므로 우리 사회 전체의 공감대 형성이 필요
▣ 외환정책은 향후 글로벌 금리 상승, 무역갈등 등으로 불확실성이 확대될 것으로 예상되므로 외환건전성 관리에 만전을 기할 필요
·장기간 과잉 유동성이 공급된 국제금융시장에 드러나지 않은 불균형이 산재해있어 미국 장단기 기간 프리미엄 역전, 기대인플레의 급격한 상승 등의 변화에 민감하게 반응하여 금융불안이 확대될 수 있으므로 금융시장에 대한 면밀한 모니터링이 필요
·경상수지 흑자, 외환보유액 등 외화유동성 측면에서 우리 경제의 펀더멘털이 튼튼하지만 무역분쟁, 중국 성장 둔화 가능성 등 최근 국제금융시장의 주요 위험요인이 우리경제와 밀접한 상관관계를 가지고 있다는 점에서 경계심을 가질 필요
·특히 최근 위안화의 변동성이 높아진 가운데 위안화 환율이 원화 환율의 움직임에 밀접한 영향을 주고 있으므로 이에 대한 면밀한 모니터링이 필요
·우리나라의 대외자산 규모가 커진 만큼 외국인자금의 유출입뿐 아니라 거주자의 대외자산에 대한 모니터링을 강화하여 국제금융시장 변동성 확대에 따른 자본손실 가능성에도 대비",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,선거의 평온 및 공정성 관련 공직선거법 규정에 대한 검토 = A Review on the Provisions of the Public Official Election Act on Tranquility and Fairness of Election,"Fairness of Election,Tranquility of Election,Electoral Campaign,Freedom of Political Expression,Public Official Election Act,선거의 공정성,선거의 평온,선거운동,정치적 표현의 자유,공직선거법","선거의 공정성과 평온의 개념은 선거민주주의에서 실시되는 경쟁적 선거를 전제로 하여 이해할 필요가 있다. 경쟁적 선거에서 정치적 경쟁은 필연적이다. 정치적 경쟁은 자유롭게 보장되어야 한다. 그런데 정치적 경쟁이 정치적 평등과 결합함에 따라 균등한 경쟁기회가 보장되어야 하는바, 여기에서 선거의 공정성이 요구된다. 한편 정치적 경쟁의 과열로 말미암은 사회적 비용의 수준을 일정하게 설정할 필요가 있는바, 여기에서 선거의 평온이 요구된다. 그러한 점에서 선거의 공정성과 평온은 선거과정 특히 선거운동 규제의 목적으로 작용하게 된다.
민주정치체제에서 경쟁적 선거가 제대로 실시되기 위해서는 정치적 독과점을 방지하고 완화하는 제도적 장치가 마련되어야 한다. 정치적 경쟁과 정치적 통제의 관점에서 볼 때, 선거운동의 자유를 균등히 보장하려는 선거의 공정성이 충분히 구현되어야 한다. 이를 위해서는 선거운동의 법리에 충실한 공정한 게임규칙으로서 선거법의 입법, 선거법의 엄정한 집행, 그리고 최종적으로는 중립적인 사법부의 감시가 중요하다.
평온 및 공정성과 관련하여 규제의 대상이 된 주요 선거운동은 비례대표후보자의 공개장소의 연설?대담, 시설물설치, 문서?도화의 배부?게시, 호별방문 등이다. 이러한 규제조항에 대하여 헌재는 모두 합헌결정을 내린 바 있다. 각 조항의 입법취지와 우리 정치적 경험 및 현실을 고려한다면 타당한 판단이라고 본다. 그러나 향후 정치적 발전을 기하기 위해서는 보다 전향적인 판단이 요청된다.
첫째, 후보자 외에 일반 선거권자의 정치적 표현의 자유를 보장하기 위해서 비용이 적게 드는 방법으로 광고물 등의 설치 등을 허용하는 것이 필요하다고 본다. 예컨대 선거운동을 할 수 있는 사람은 누구든지 선거운동기간 중에 자신의 집이나 자동차에 선거운동을 위한 표시물을 부착?게시하는 것을 허용할 필요가 있다.
또한 선거에 직접 영향을 미치지 않는 시설물 설치의 규제를 다소 완화하는 방안도 고려할 수 있다.
둘째, 제93조 제1항의 위헌성을 판단함에 있어서 후보자와 일반 국민을 구분할 필요가 있다고 본다. 후보자의 경우, 아직까지의 우리 선거문화와 선거비용관리체계를 고려한다면 제93조 제1항에 의한 제한은 선거의 자유와 공정을 보장하기 위한 제도적 장치로서, 선거운동에 있어서의 특정한 수단, 특히 폐해의 우려가 크다고 인정되는 인쇄물?녹음 등의 배부?살포 등 특정한 선거운동방법에 국한되는 것이므로, 과잉금지원칙에 위반하여 선거운동의 자유 등을 제한하거나 그 본질적 내용을 침해하지 않는다고 본다. 그러나 일반 국민의 경우, 선거가 정치세력에 대한 국민의 정치적 통제에 해당하기 때문에 선거정보의 공유 차원에서 정치적 표현의 자유를 최대한 존중하여야 할 것이다. 그러한 점에서 현행 조항에 따른 기간 및 행위양식의 제한은 지나치다고 본다.
셋째, 우리의 현실을 고려할 때, 현행법상 호별방문 제한은 당분간 유용성을 갖는다고 본다. 특히 시골지역의 효과적인 선거정보의 전달을 위하여 선거관리위원회가 주관하는 소규모의 토론회를 수시로 개최할 필요가 있다고 본다.
헌재는 정치적 중립자의 입장에서 선거관계법의 위헌여부를 심사하며 선거과정에서 침해당한 기본권을 구제하는 민주주의 정치과정의 심판자라 할 수 있다. 민주적 정치과정의 심판자로서 헌재의 주요 ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,태양광 폐패널의 관리 실태조사 및 개선방안 연구 = Management Status and Improvement Plans of Waste Solar Panels,"태양광 폐패널, 관리 현황, 환경 영향, 재활용 체계, 환경성보장제도, Waste Solar Panel, Management Status, Environmental impact, Recycling system, EcoAS","현재 세계 각국에서는 태양광발전 중심의 에너지믹스 재편을 통해 지속가능한 신·재생에너지 보급 확대에 박차를 가하고 있다. 국내의 경우에도 2000년대 들어 태양광 산업이 본격적으로 시작된 이래, 2017년 기준으로 국내 태양광발전설비는 5.7GW 규모(총 신재생 에너지 발전용량의 30%에 해당)로 설치되었으며, 신·재생에너지원 중 전년 대비 가장 큰 성장률을 보이고 있다. 또한 재생에너지 3020 이행계획(2018년부터 2030년까지 총 30.8GW 추가 설치 예정)에 따라 앞으로 태양광설비 역시 크게 확대될 것으로 전망된다.
하지만 태양광 산업이 성장함에 따라 태양광 폐패널 처리 문제가 크게 부각하고 있다. 태양광설비가 손상되거나 폐기 시 발생하는 폐패널이 현재 관리체계 미흡으로 그대로 방치되거나 단순 매립되는 등 부적정하게 처리되는 사례가 파악되고 있다. 2000년대 들어 태양광사업이 본격적으로 시작된 이후 파손·자연재해 등으로 인해 실제 사용기한이 15∼20년에 그치고 있으며, 도로용 및 통신전원용의 경우는 5년에 불과하여 현재 폐패널이 본격적으로 발생되는 시점에 와 있다. 이러한 태양광 폐패널에는 종류에 따라 납 뿐만 아니라 발암성 물질인 크롬, 카드뮴이 포함되어 있어 부적정하게 처리될 경우 환경오염을 초래할 우려가 높다. 이미 EU, 일본 등 해외에서는 태양광 폐패널 처리 문제를 미리 인식하여 2010년 초반부터 적정 처리방안을 모색하고, 폐패널의 관리체계 구축 및 재활용기술 개발을 발빠르게 진행하고 있다. 한편 국내 태양광설비의 경우 설치에 관련된 규정만 존재하고 사용 후 처리 규정이 미흡한 상황이다.
이에 본 연구에서는 태양광 패널의 폐기 이후 관리 실태조사 및 유해물질 분석을 통한 환경영향 측면의 검토를 통해 태양광 폐패널의 관리상 문제점을 도출하고 이에 대한 개선방안을 제시하고자 한다. 이를 위해 태양광 셀/패널 제조업체, 임대업체, 시공업체, 철거업체, 재활용업체(종합재활용업), 지자체, 충북테크노파크, 한국에너지기술연구원, 한국전자제품자원순환공제조합, 한국순환자원유통지원센터, 한국환경공단 등의 현장조사 및 실무자 인터뷰를 통해 현황을 파악하고 업계 의견을 수렴하였다.
본 연구에서는 폐자원 흐름의 분석 대상으로 “실리콘계 결정질 태양광 폐패널”을 선정하였다. 해당 태양광 패널의 국내 보급률이 90% 이상이며, 국내 제조업체가 가장 많이 생산하는 종류에 해당하기 때문이다. 이때 ‘폐패널’이란 재사용이 가능한 상태로 배출되어 중고물품 혹은 등외품으로 판매되는 ‘중고패널’과 재사용이 불가능한 상태로 배출되어 현재 매립 처분되고 있는 ‘폐기패널’을 모두 포함한다.
또한 국내 태양광 폐패널의 형태는 ① 사용 후 발생된 폐패널과 ② 제조 과정에서 발생하는 공정부산물로 크게 구분할 수 있다. 전자의 경우는 주택(가정 및 공동주택), 공공기관, 발전소 등에서 발생되고, 후자의 경우는 태양광 셀/패널 제조업체에서 주로 발생된다. 사용 후 발생된 폐패널의 배출 원인은 크게 “고장 등으로 인한 교체”와 “사용만료, 리모델링, 철거 등으로 인한 폐기”의 두 가지로 나눌 수 있다. 일반적으로 전자의 경우 소량의 폐패널이 배출되고, 후자의 경우 다량의 폐패널이 배출된다. 현재까지는 사용 후 철거된 폐패널의 발생량은 그리 많지 않으며, 대부분은 시공 과정에서 불량품으로 반품되어 발생되고 있다.
태양광 패널 중 관리부실로 인해 유리가 파손되거나 출력이 저하되는 경우가 있으며, 자연재해로 인해 일부 태양광 패널의 사용이 불가능해질 수도 있다. 일부 시공업체의 실무자 인터뷰에 따르면, 현재는 관리 부실로 인한 유리 파손이 고장 사례의 대부분을 차지하고 있는 것으로 파악된다. 이 경우, 태양광 패널의 일부를 새 제품으로 교체하는 과정에서 폐패널이 발생한다. 한편 시공업체에서 태양광발전설비를 설치하면서 패널이 파손되는 경우도 존재한다. 발생원별 세부 흐름을 가정용, 공공용, 발전사용으로 나누어 조사하면 다음과 같다.
가정용의 경우, 새 제품 교체로 인해 폐패널 발생 시 발전시설 운영·관리자인 ① 임대업체 혹은 ② 시공업체에서 이를 수거한다. 한편 제품 자체 문제로 인해 고장이 난 패널을 교체해야 하는 경우에는 제조업체에서 회수한다. 시공업체 실무자 인터뷰에 따르면, 과거에 진공상태인 유리와 백시트(back sheet) 사이에 제품 하자로 습기가 생겨 백화 현상이 발생했던 사례가 있었다. 하지만 일반적으로 제품 자체의 하자로 인한 고장 확률은 매우 낮은 것으로 확인되었다. 보다 세부적인 흐름을 임대업체와 시공업체로 나누어 살펴보면 다음과 같다. 우선. 임대업체의 경우 태양광 대여사업으로 보급된 가정용 태양광발전설비에 한해 임대기간내에 고장 패널을 관리한다. 임대업체에서 판단하여 고장의 원인이 일부 부품의 문제일 경우에는 자체적으로 수리하여 폐패널이 발생하지 않는다. 한편 운영·관리 문제로 인한 고장으로 일부 패널을 교체해야 할 경우 임대업체에서 새 제품으로 고장이 난 패널을 교환하고 폐패널을 회수한다. 반면 패널 자체에 문제가 있을 경우에는 보증기간 이내의 제품은 제조회사로 보내고 보증기간 이후 혹은 보증 불가 제품은 소비자부담으로 제조회사에 직접 구매하거나 임대업체에서 새 제품의 구매를 대행해 준다. 즉, 전자의 경우에는 제조회사에서, 후자의 경우 제조회사 혹은 임대업체에서 폐패널을 회수한다. 그 밖에 자연재해 등으로 인해 시공보증이나 제품/출력보증이 불가능한 경우 소비자는 시공업체, 제조업체, 임대업체 등을 통해 새 제품을 구매할 수 있으며, 각 구매 경로를 통해 폐패널이 회수된다. 한편 정부의 주택지원사업을 받는 가정용 태양광설비를 설치한 시공업체가 파산하는 경우가 발생하고 있다. 현재 한국에너지공단에서는 시공업체의 부도 및 폐업 등으로 인해 사용자가 불이익을 받지 않도록 A/S 신청을 받고 있으며, 이 경우 타 시공 및 운영·관리업체를 통해 폐패널이 배출될 수 있다.
고장으로 인한 교체로 발생한 공공용 폐패널은 입찰을 통해 선정된 시공업체 및 운영·관리업체 혹은 지자체에서 주로 관리한다. 이때 발생한 폐패널은 시공보증 가능 여부에 따라 폐패널 수거처가 상이하다. 시공보증이 가능한 경우, 부품 등으로 인해 발생한 단순 고장은 시공업체에서 처리하며, 시공 문제로 인해 발생한 고장의 경우에는 시공업체에서 새 제품으로 교환한다. 이 과정에서 시공업체에서 폐패널이 발생된다. 시공보증 기간 이후 혹은 제품의 문제로 고장이 발생한 경우에는 시공보증이 불가능하다. 이는 세부적으로 제품 문제, 관리자 과실 등으로 나눌 수 있다. 제품 자체 문제로 인해 고장이 발생한 경우에는 제품보증 혹은 출력보증을 받을 수 있으며, 각각 제조업체에서 수거하여 새 제품으로 교환한다. 이때 제조업체로 폐패널이 회수된다. 관리자 과실로 인해 고장이 발생한 경우에는 담당 관리자(시공업체, 운영·관리업체 등)가 회수하여 새 제품으로 교환해 준 후 폐패널을 수거한다. 그 밖에 자연재해로 인해 시공보증 혹은 제품/출력보증을 받지 못하는 경우도 있다. 이때 소유자는 시공업체, 운영·관리업체, 제조업체를 통해 새 제품을 구매하며, 구매 경로를 통해 폐패널을 배출하게 된다.
발전사용은 지자체, 정부, 개인 등 사업비 출처에 따라 운영·관리자가 상이하다. 자체적으로 운영하는 사업의 경우는 지자체, 시공업체, 운영·관리업체에서, 정부의 보조금이 지급되어 운영되거나 혹은 개인이 자발적으로 운영하는 발전소의 경우는 주로 사업자, 시공업체, 운영·관리업체에서 각각 운영·관리를 맡는다. 발전사용의 경우, 고장 등으로 인해 폐패널이 발생하는 흐름은 공공용과 유사하다.
다음으로, 태양광발전설비의 사용만료, 출력 저하로 인한 전체 리모델링, 발전시설 폐쇄 등으로 폐패널을 다량 철거해야 하는 경우가 존재한다. 하지만 보통 제품 보증기간이 25년정도 되는 만큼 다량 철거되는 사례는 아직까지는 거의 없는 상황이다. 가정용 중 임대사업을 통해 설치된 태양광발전설비는 철거된 사례가 거의 없으나, 일부 발생된 폐패널은 임대업체를 통해 철거된 것으로 나타났다. 반면 정부, 지자체, 개인 비용으로 시공업체를 통해 설치된 시설은 시공업체 혹은 철거업체 등을 통해 철거될 수 있다. 후자를 통한 태양광설비철거 시 비용은 태양광 폐패널 혹은 구조물 매입비용에서 철거비용을 제하는 형태로 지불된다. 단, 철거가 어려운 경사길이나 산 중턱, 높은 건물의 옥상 등에 태양광발전설비가 설치된 경우는 인건비, 철거기구 비용, 차량비용 등에 대한 추가비용이 산정되기도 한다. 가정용 미니태양광의 경우는 260~300W이며, 주택보급용은 3kW 수준이기 때문에 시공업체에서 자체적으로 처리하는 경우가 많을 것으로 판단된다. 공공용의 경우 업계 실무자 인터뷰에 따르면 아직까지 철거된 사례가 보고되고 있지 않으나, 향후 철거될 시에는 입찰을 통해 철거업체가 선정되는 방식이 될 것으로 조사되었다. 발전사용의 경우 시공업체에서도 철거가 가능하나 최소 3,000~5,000장 수준으로 발생하거나 5MW 규모의 발전시설인 경우에는 별도의 철거업체에 작업을 의뢰할 것으로 파악되었다.
사용만료·리모델링·폐쇄 등으로 인해 발전시설을 철거하는 경우에는 폐패널, 알루미늄지지대, 인버터, 구리전선 등이 배출된다. 배출된 폐패널은 철거 및 유통업체의 자체 외관상 검사를 통해 재사용이 가능한 중고패널과 재사용이 불가능한 폐기패널로 구분된다. 재사용이 가능한 중고패널은 철거업체 혹은 중고 태양광 패널 유통업체를 통해 제3국(방글라데시, 스리랑카, 나이지리아, 예멘, 인도, 아프가니스탄, 파키스탄 등) 바이어를 대상으로 판매·수출된다. 업체 실무자 인터뷰에 따르면, 제3국의 바이어들은 사용이 만료된 패널의 출력이 150W에만 도달해도 구매하는 것으로 나타났으며, 이는 재사용 목적이 발전사용이 아닌 가정소규모형이기 때문이다. 하지만 해외 판로의 경우 시장 상황에 따라 수출이 불가능해질 수 있으므로 이를 유념할 필요가 있다. 현재 국내에는 태양광 폐패널에 대한 재사용 인증기준이 부재하여 재사용 시장이 형성되어 있지 않은 상황이다. 다만, 재활용기술 개발을 위한 실증시험이나 성능평가, 자연열화 등의 연구용으로 중고패널 매매가 이루어지고 있다. 그 밖에 알루미늄 지지대와 재사용이 불가능한 폐패널에 부착된 알루미늄(A-10계열)은 수작업으로 해체되어 지역 고물상(중·대상) 등을 통해 최종적으로 알루미늄 제조업체로 판매되고 있다. 알루미늄이 제거된 폐패널에는 강화유리, 실리콘, 구리, 은 등이 포함되어 있으나 현재 상용화된 재활용기술이 없어 파쇄 전문업체에서 파쇄한 후 이를 전량 매립하고 있다.
두 번째 태양광 폐패널의 발생 유형은 태양광 셀/패널 제조업체에서 공정 중 배출되는 부산물로, 폐패널, 파손셀, 유리, 프레임, EVA, 백시트, 실리콘, 리본, 알루미늄 페이스트 및 보루, 은 페이스트 및 보루 등이 주로 배출된다. 공정부산물은 사업장 일반·지정폐기물로 배출되거나 매각되는 것으로 조사되었다. 공정부산물의 경우 배출 및 수거 단계, 재사용 단계, 전처리 및 자원회수 단계, 활용 단계로 나누어 검토하면 각 단계의 흐름은 다음과 같다.
우선, 국내 태양광 셀 제조업체에서는 알루미늄 페이스트, 은 페이스트, 은 보루 등이 배출되고, 패널 제조업체에서는 폐패널, 파손셀, 폐유리, 프레임, EVA, 백시트, 실리콘, 리본 등이 배출된다. 이들은 각각 폐유리, 폐전기·전자제품류 및 폐합성수지, 폐유리, 알루미늄, 폐합성고분자화합물 및 폐합성수지, 구리 등의 폐기물 코드로 등록되어 중간처리업체에 보내지거나 매각된다. 특히, 폐패널 및 파손셀은 처리업체에 판매된 이후에 재사용되고 있다. 폐패널 중 일부는 출력효율이 일정 기준 이하로 떨어지거나 외관상 불량이 있는 등외품으로서 등급(B급, C급)이 나뉘어 배출되며, 국내 오퍼상 혹은 처리업체 등을 통해 해외로 판매되고 있다. 전기·전자제품류로 배출되는 파손셀 역시 처리업체에 판매된 이후에 파손 정도(50%, 70%, 90%)에 따라 분류된 후 해외에 수출되고 있다. 그 밖에 일부 EVA와 백시트는 파손셀과 함께 수출되어 소형 태양광 패널을 만드는 데 함께 사용되기도 한다.
재사용되는 공정부산물을 제외한 폐패널 및 폐셀, 알루미늄 페이스트, 알루미늄 보루, 은 페이스트, 은 보루, 폐유리, 프레임, EVA, 백시트, 실리콘, 리본은 각각 다른 흐름으로 처리된다. 폐패널 및 폐셀은 파·분쇄된 후 매립 처분되고 있다. 이러한 폐패널 및 폐셀에는 은이 일정량 함유되어 있으나 최근 은 가격이 상당히 떨어져 은을 별도로 추출할 만한 경제적 유인이 없는 상황이다. 또한 폐패널에 포함된 리본(와이어)에는 구리 함유량이 80% 가량되지만 폐패널에서 구리를 별도로 분리할 수 없어 함께 폐기되고 있다. 알루미늄 페이스트는 중간처리업체에서 처리된 후 고온 소각되고 있으며, 알루미늄 보루는 지정폐기물로 분쇄된 후 매립 처분되고 있다. 알루미늄 보루의 경우는 아스팔트 등으로 재활용이 가능하나, 소량으로 배출되기 때문에 현재 매립되고 있다. 은 페이스트와 은 보루는 재활용 처리를 통해 은이 추출되어 은 도매상에 판매된다. 폐유리는 파·분쇄 및 재활용업체에 보내져 재생유리로 생산되고 있다. 패널에 부착된 프레임은 A-10계열로 순도가 높아 수요가 많은 것으로 조사되었으며, 고물상을 거쳐 알루미늄 제조업체에 판매된다. EVA와 백시트는 재활용업체에서 처리되며, 실리콘은 소량으로 배출되어 소각되고 있다. 리본은 구리업체에 매각되거나 재활용업체에 보내져 구리가 회수된다.
또한 본 연구에서는 태양광 폐패널의 환경영향 측면을 검토하기 위하여 국내에 보급된 태양광 폐패널 시료 4종을 확보하여 국립환경과학원의 협조를 얻어 과학원에서 용출 분석 및 함량 분석을 수행하였다. 용출 분석 대상 중금속은 7가지 금속(Cu, Pb, Cd, As, Hg, Cr, Cr6+)이며, 이를 분석한 결과 3가지 금속(Cu, Hg, Cr6+)이 모든 시료에서 정량한계 이하로 검출되었다. 반면 납(Pb)은 모든 시료에서 0.064~0.541mg/L의 범위로 분석되었으며, 3종의 샘플에서 비소(As)가 0.008~0.138mg/L 범위로 검출되었다. 「폐기물관리법시행규칙」의 ‘[별표1] 지정폐기물에 함유된 유해물질’에 명시된 지정폐기물 기준에 따르면 7가지 중금속 모두 지정폐기물 기준 미만으로 검출되었다. 다음으로, 함량 분석은 6가지 중금속(Cu, Pb, Cd, As, Hg, Cr)을 대상으로 수행되었다. 그 결과, 2가지 중금속(Cd, Hg)이 검출한계 미만으로 나타났으며, 4가지 중금속(Cu, Pb, As, Cr)은 모두 검출되었다. 특히 납의 함량을 분석한 결과 88.7~201.8mg/kg의 범위로 나타났다. 이는 폐패널에 다량의 납이 포함되어 있음을 의미하며, 깨진 폐패널 등이 부적정하게 관리될 경우 납 유출로 인한 환경 및 인체 영향 가능성을 시사한다.
상기의 발생원별 폐자원 흐름 조사 및 유해물질 분석 결과를 바탕으로, 태양광 폐패널의 관리상 문제점 및 검토사항을 다음의 5가지 측면에서 도출하였다. 첫째, 태양광 폐패널에 대한 관리체계가 미흡한 상황이다. 태양광설비가 손상되거나 폐기 시 발생하는 폐패널이 그대로 방치되거나 단순 매립되고 있다. 일부 시공업체에서는 이를 혼합건설폐기물로 처리하여 이후 매립지로 보내지고 있으나, 현행 「건설폐기물의 재활용촉진에 관한 법률」에 따르면 태양광발전설비는 건설폐기물로 처리되어서는 아니 된다. 또한 폐패널이 부적정하게 처리 될 경우 납 등 유해물질에 따른 환경 유해성 우려가 높다. 향후 다량의 폐패널이 발생하고 재활용이 이루어지지 않는 경우에는 상당량이 매립되어 매립지 부족이 우려된다.
둘째, 태양광 폐패널에 대한 통계관리가 미흡하다. 2016년 7월 21일부터 태양광 폐패널은 「폐기물관리법 시행규칙」 ‘[별표4] 폐기물의 종류별 세부분류’ 중 폐전지류 내 ‘폐태양전지·전자기기페이스트’에 포함되고 있다. 즉, 「폐기물관리법」 제18조제3항에 따라 배출, 수집·운반, 재활용 또는 처분할 때마다 사업장폐기물 수집·운반업자에 의해 운반되어야 하며, 일정량 이상이 될 경우 올바로시스템에 입력되어야 한다. 이를 통해 2017년 12월 31일까지 올바로시스템에 태양광 패널 관련 업체들의 변경신청이 완료되어야 하나 현재 등록된 업체가 전혀 없는 상황이다. 그 원인으로는 제조업체를 포함하여 시공업체 등 관련 사업장에서는 폐기물 분류코드를 인지하지 못하거나, 인지하고 있더라도 올바로시스템에 입력하기 위해서는 3자계약(배출자-운반자-처리자) 원칙에 따라 태양광 폐패널 재활용업체가 없을 경우 등록할 수 없기 때문이다. 이로 인해 태양광 폐패널에 대한 기초정보를 파악하기 어려운 상황이다. 또한 태양광 폐패널은 현재 태양광 도소매업자 혹은 건물철거업자 등에 의해 철거되고 있으나, 철거 이후 별도의 전산처리 및 신고가 전혀 이루어지지 않고 있다. 향후 급증할 것으로 예상되는 태양광 폐패널의 적정 관리 및 관련 인프라 구축을 위해서는 통계관리를 선행할 필요가 있다.
셋째, 재사용에 대한 국내 인증기준이 부재하다. 현재 발생된 폐패널은 국내 재사용에 대한 인증기준이 부재하여 대부분 해외 동남아시아 등으로 수출되고 있다. 하지만 해외 판로의 경우 시장 상황에 따라 수출이 불가능해질 수 있으므로 국내 재사용 시장을 활성화할 필요가 있다. 이를 위해서는 재사용 패널에 대한 인증기준이 마련되어야 하며, 수요처 확대가 과제이다.
넷째, 현재 폐패널은 해외 재사용 이외에 단순 매립 처분되고 있다. 국내에서 제조된 태양광 폐패널 시료를 용출 분석한 결과 납, 비소 등이 검출된 바 있으며, 이는 깨진 폐패널이 부적정하게 처리될 경우 환경오염을 초래할 수 있음을 의미한다. 또한 국내 최종처분업체 매립시설의 경우, 총 매립용량 대비 잔여매립용량 비중이 2013년 기준 50%에서 계속 하락하여 2016년에는 30.1%에 해당한다. 앞으로 폐패널이 다량 배출되어 현행처럼 매립에만 의존할 경우에는 매립지 잔여용량 부족에 직접적인 영향을 미칠 것으로 전망된다.
다섯째, 태양광 패널의 폐기 이후 철거·운반 등에 대한 안전지침이 부재하다. 태양광발전설비 취급 시 감전 및 낙상위험이 있으므로 철거 단계에서부터 주의가 필요하다. 태양광 패널은 빛이 닿으면 발전하기 때문에 감전 방지를 위해 표면을 차광용 시트로 덮고, 절연장갑, 고무장화를 착용하거나 절연 처리된 공구를 사용하여 위험을 줄일 필요가 있다.
상기에 명시된 태양광 폐패널의 관리상 문제점 및 검토사항에 대해 다음의 방향성 ― ① “최종처분(매립) 부하 및 유해물질 부하 저감”, ② “불법투기 방지”, ③ “재활용 추진”, ④ “재사용에 의한 수명연장”, ⑤ “철거, 운반, 처리비용의 적절한 부담” 실현 ― 에 기반하여 크게 5가지 측면에서 개선방안을 검토하였다.
첫째, 태양광 폐패널의 회수 및 적정처리를 위해 “현행 단계 - 과도기 단계(시범사업) - 재활용기술 상용화 이후 단계”로 구분하여 재사용/재활용체계(안)을 제시하였다. 현재 일부 태양광 패널 제조업체에서는 플라스틱(합성수지류)에 대해 폐기물부담금을 부과하고 있다. 폐기물부담금제도는 재활용이 어려운 품목에 대한 환경 비용을 제조업체가 부담하는 것으로 폐기물이 배출된 이후의 수거 등 관리체계가 부재하다.
향후 재활용기술이 상용화될 경우, 환경성보장제도(생산자책임 강화)를 통해 제품 설계에서부터 최종 재활용에 이르기까지의 체계적인 관리체계 마련이 필요하나, 그 이전까지는 과도기 단계로서 시범사업을 진행할 필요가 있다. 즉, 재활용기술이 상용화되는 시점까지는 현재 방치되거나 매립 처분되고 있는 태양광 폐패널을 회수 및 보관할 수 있도록 수거체계를 마련하고 이에 따른 통계관리가 이루어져야 할 것이다. 이때 거점 회수지점으로는 전기·전자제품 자원순환공제조합의 지역별 폐전기·전자제품 수집소나 지자체 폐가전제품 재활용센터 등을 활용할 수 있다. 이를 통해 현재 어디서 얼마나 폐패널이 발생하고 있는지에 대한 데이터를 수집하고, 회수체계 구축 및 수거·운반에 드는 비용 등을 산출함으로써 이후 환경성보장제도 시행 시 필요한 재활용의무량을 산정하는 데 활용하여야 할 것이다.
이후 태양광 폐패널에 대한 재활용이 가능해질 경우 환경성보장제도 품목에 태양광 패널을 포함하여 제품 설계에서부터 최종 재활용에 이르기까지 적정 관리가 가능하도록 의무생산자 역할을 확대(폐패널에 대한 수거, 운반, 재활용처리에 대한 보고책임, 정보제공책임, 폐패널 취급 안내 등)할 필요가 있다. 단, 환경성보장제도의 경우 제품군별로 의무율이 일괄적으로 책정(2018년 기준, 6kg/인)되어 있으며, 세부 제품별로 별도 관리 하고 있지 않으므로 적용 초기에는 태양광 패널만의 별도 회수율 및 재활용 의무율 산정이 필요하다. 현재 매립되고 있는 폐패널이 재활용으로 전환되는 물량에 기초하여 태양광 폐패널의 수거량, 수출ㆍ수입량, 재활용시설의 규모, 재활용기술의 개발상황, 제품의 내구연수 등 재활용에 영향을 미치는 요인을 고려하여 정해야 할 것이다.
둘째, 재사용 인증기준 마련을 통해 국내에서의 재사용을 촉진할 필요가 있다. 현재 태양광 폐패널의 대부분이 철거업체 및 도소매업체를 통해 해외로 판매되고 있으나 해외시장의 경우 불확실성이 존재한다. 따라서 국내 시장을 활성화할 필요가 있으며 이를 위해서는 외관검사, 패널 세정, 절연저항검사, 출력검사, EL카메라검사, 바이패스다이오드검사 등을 실시하여 제품의 안정성을 우선 확보하여야 할 것이다. 이와 동시에 「전기·전자제품 및 자동차의 자원순환에 관한 법률 시행규칙」 제5조의4에 명시된 재사용방법 기준에 따라 태양광 폐패널이 국내에서 재사용될 경우 이를 회수실적으로 인정할 필요가 있다.
셋째, 철거 사업자에 대한 정의 및 자격요건에 대한 검토가 필요하다. 태양광발전설비는 주로 시공업체에 의해 설치되며 설치자에 대한 정의와 자격요건이 법령에 명시되어 있는 반면, 태양광 폐패널은 시공업체 혹은 철거업체 등에 의해 철거되고 있으나 철거자에 대한 정의나 자격요건은 부재한 상황이다. 이에 본 연구에서는 「신재생에너지 설비의 지원 등에 관한 규정」 개선(안)을 통해 “철거자”에 대한 정의와 전기공사업 등 자격조건을 명시하였다.
넷째, 폐패널을 저비용으로 해체하기 위한 재활용기술 지원이 필요하다. 태양광 패널 제조업체에서는 화학물질 사용 저감 등을 추진하고 있지만, 25년 이상 장기적으로 사용되는 태양광 패널의 특성상 최근에는 해체가 용이하지 않은 패널이 생산되고 있다. 또한 패널내 은 함유량이 감소하는 경향이 있기 때문에 앞으로 저비용 분해처리 기술, 저비용 철거·분리·회수 기술을 개발할 필요가 있으며, 제품의 설계에서부터 재사용이나 환경성을 고려하는 설계가 요구된다.
다섯째, 철거·재사용·재활용을 위한 안전지침(안)을 마련할 필요가 있다. 이에 폐패널의 배출 이후 해체·철거 단계 - 재사용 단계 - 재활용 단계별 주의사항을 제시하였다.
여섯째, 태양광 폐패널의 재활용 및 적정 처리를 위한 향후 추진과제를 검토하였다. 무엇보다도 현재 방치되거나 단순 매립되고 있는 태양광 폐패널을 회수하기 위한 수거체계 마련이 우선되어야 하며, 이를 위해서는 지역별 배출 예상량을 추정하여 대상 지자체에서의 시범
사업을 통해 통계 데이터를 확보할 필요가 있다. 이후 회수된 폐패널을 대상으로 자원가치를 평가하여 철거-재활용 비용효과를 분석하고, 중장기적으로는 저비용 해체 및 신기술 도입타당성을 검토하여야 할 것이다. 특히, 국내에서의 재사용을 촉진하기 위해 인증기준 및 재사용지침을 마련하고, 환경성보장제도 내에서 재사용된 양을 회수실적으로 인정하여 포함시킬 필요가 있다. 이를 통해 향후 다량 배출될 것으로 예상되는 태양광 폐패널을 재사용 또는 재활용하여 적정 관리하는 동시에, 패널의 설계 단계에서부터 유해물질 사용 저감 및 해체·재활용 용이성을 고려하여 전 과정에 걸친 자원순환 체계가 정립되어야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,노폴트 보험제도의 발전사에 관한 연구 -미국의 노폴트 보험제도를 중심으로- = A Study on the Development History of No-Fault Insurance System: Focusing on the U.S. No-Fault Insurance System,"노폴트 보험제도,과실책임제도,자동차보험,자율주행자동차,No-Fault Insurance System,Automobile Insurance,Autonomous Vehicle,Tort System","노폴트 보험제도는 자동차사고의 발생하면 가해자의 과실책임 여부나 피해자의 지위에관계없이 피해자가 가입하고 있는 보험회사에서 피해자의 인적 손해를 보상하는 무과실자동차보험제도이다. 노폴트 보험제도는 피해자가 직접 보험회사나 정부로부터 보상을 받는 제1당사자형보험으로 가해자에 대한 피해자의 불법행위 손해배상청구권을 제한함으로써 과실여부를 다투는데 소요되는 비용과 시간을 줄이고 피해자에게 충분하고 신속한 보상을 실시하는 것을 목적으로 하고 있다. 미국식 노폴트 보험제도는 보험료의 과도한 인상, 도덕적 해이로 인한 보험사기, 제소권 제한의 실효권 상실 등의 문제점이 지적되어제도에 대한 회의적인 시각도 제기되고 있다. 하지만 자율주행자동차의 등장과 지능형교통시스템의 구축과 같이 교통환경의 변화가 초래되면서 운전자 과실 중심의 기존 체제를적용하기 어렵고, 이로 인해 자동차사고의 피해자구제는 특정 개인이 아닌 공동체 전제의책임이라는 점이 지적되고 있어 자동차보험의 패러다임에도 변화가 필요할 것으로 예상되는데, 이와 관련하여 노폴트 보험제도가 적절한 대안될 수 있을 것이라는 주장도 제시되고 있다.
본 연구는 노폴트 보험제도를 채택하고 있는 대표적인 국가인 미국에서 운영하고 있는노폴트 보험제도의 특성과 발전과정을 살펴보았고, 우리나라에서 현재 채택하고 있는 과실책임제도에서는 급격하게 변화하고 있는 인공지능을 접목하는 자동차운행의 기술환경에서 발생할 수 있는 자동차사고에 대해서 적절한 피해자 구제를 할 수 없기 때문에 기존의 과실책임제도를 보완할 수 있어야 하는데, 이에 적합한 해결방안으로 노폴트 보험제도에 대한 도입적합성을 살펴보았다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,자율주행시대 보험제도로서 노폴트보험의 적합성 여부에 대한 고찰,,"□ 노폴트보험(No-Fault)은 자동차사고 발생 시 피해자의 지위나 가해자의 책임 여부에 관계없이 피해자가 가입한 보험회사가 피해자의 인적 손해를 보상하는 보험으로, 미국, 캐나다, 뉴질랜드 등이 도입하고 있음

ㆍ 제소권을 제한함으로써 소송 등을 통해 과실 여부를 다투는 데 소요되는 시간과 비용을 줄이고 피해자에 대한 신속하고 충분한 보상을 실시하는 것이 노폴트보험 제도의 목적임
□ 자율주행시대가 본격 도래하게 되면 자동차보험의 패러다임에도 변화가 필요할 수 있을 것으로 예상되는데, 이와 관련하여 노폴트보험이 적절한 대안이 될 수 있다는 견해가 제기되고 있음
ㆍ 자율주행사고에 대해서는 운전자 과실 중심의 기존 체계를 적용하기 어렵다는 점, 자동차사고 피해자 구제는 특정 개인이 아닌 공동체 전체의 책임이라는 점이 지적됨
ㆍ 위와 같은 점을 근거로, 자율주행시대에는 미국식 노폴트보험 또는 뉴질랜드식 노폴트보험 도입이 필요하다는 주장이 제기되고 있음
□ 미국식 노폴트보험은 도덕적 해이, 보험료의 과도한 인상, 제소권 제한의 실효성 상실 등 다양한 문제점이 지적되어 미국에서도 제도 자체에 대한 회의적인 시각이 확산되고 있음
ㆍ 또한, 우리나라 자배법은 이미 자동차사고에 대해 준무과실책임 법제를 도입하고, 가불금, 가지급금 등 신속한 피해자 구제를 위한 여러 장치를 마련하고 있으므로, 미국식 노폴트보험 도입은 큰 실익이 없음
□ 뉴질랜드식 노폴트보험은 민간보험이 아닌 사회보험 형태로 운영되고 있어 우리나라 자동차보험과는 그 체계가 전혀 다르므로, 도입 여부에 대해서는 신중한 검토가 필요함

우선 자율주행자동차는 윤리적인 기준을 설계할 필요가 있다. 완전 자율주행자동차의 경우 자연인의 가치판단이 없는 교통사고가 발생할 수 있기 때문이다. 사회적 공론화를 통해 한국인의 의식에 부합하는 기준을 만들어야 한다. 한편, 법제도적으로 규제 샌드박스 제도가 시행되고 있다. 그러나 이는 임시적인 조치일 뿐이므로 법적 준비가 필요하다. 현재까지 국회에 올라와 있는 개정안들은 행정규제 관련 법률 또는 개인정보보호 관련 법률에 대해서 일부 법적 쟁점을 해결하려는 시도였다. 개정안들이 통과된다고 하더라도 일부분에 대한 법적인 이슈를 해결하는 정도에 그칠 것이다. 그런데 최근 자율주행 상용화를 대비하기 위한 의미있는 법률 제·개정이 이루어졌다. 이는 2020년 5월 1일부터 시행되고 있는 자율주행자동차법과 2020년 10월 8일부터 시행될 예정인 자동차손해배상 보장법 개정안이다. 특히 자율주행자동차법은 자율주행자동차의 도입·확산과 안전한 운행을 위한 운행기반 조성 및 지원 등에 필요한 사항을 규정하였다. 자율주행자동차의 상용화 촉진에 관한 법적 기반을 마련하였지만 아직 시행 초기단계인 만큼 해당 법률 내용에 정부의 시책들이 다양한 측면에서 담길 수 있도록 발전되어야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  우리나라도 비슷한 시기에 산업자원통상부에서 ‘미래차 강국 도약을 위한 범정부 전략’을 발표하면서 자율주행자동차에 대한 기술적 지원을 아끼지 않겠다는 점을 강조하였지만, 자율주행자동차를 어떠한 영역에서 어떠한 단계로 활용할 것인지에 관한 정책이나 법제의 정비에 대하여는 구체적인 언급을 하지 않은 상태이다. 그러므로 본고에서 살펴본 일본의 위 대강은 우리나라의 향후 자율주행자동차에 대한 정책이나 법제를 마련함에 있어서 참고할 만한 사례가 될 것이라 생각한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

하지만, 이중임금제는 자신의 임금과 고용을 지키기 위한 기존 노조원들의 집단이기주의의 산물일 뿐만 아니라 입사도 하지 않은 잠재 신규인력에게 저임금이라는 차별을 부과하는 노사담합의 대표적인 예이다. 또한 노동조합의 전통적인 임금정책인 임금표준화정책으로부터의 명백한 이탈이며, 단일한 종업원 집단을 두 개의 임률이 각각 적용되는 종업원 집단으로 양분한다는 점에서 노동자 연대를 포기하는 정책이다. 이 논문은 노동조합 조직의 근본 목적과 정책에 반하는 이중임금제가 미국 노조들에 의해 왜, 그리고 어떻게 출현하게 되었는가에 주목한다. 그리고 우리나라 자동차산업 등에서 이중임금제를 포함한 노동자 연대의 약화, 노조내 집단 이기주의, 임금표준화정책의 후퇴 등이 발생할 가능성을 검토하고자 한다. 우리나라에서도 이중임금제의 초기형태인 대졸초임 삭감 등과 함께 정규직만의 임금 극대화 임금정책 추구와 임금표준화정책의 외면 등이 발생한 바 있다. 다양한 비정규직에 대한 정규직의 외면, 신규인력 채용을 둘러싼 노사간의 담합과 노조의 수뢰, 광주형 일자리 모델에 대한 금속노조의 반발 등의 현상 역시 이와 관련된 현상이다. 이러한 현상들은 결국 미국 자동차산업의 이중임금제가 미국만의 현상이 아니며, 우리나라 자동차산업에서도 동일하게 재현될 가능성이 높음을 뜻한다. 또한 우리나라 자동차산업에도 이중임금제로 대표되는 노사간의 담합과 노조 내 집단이기주의가 발생할 조건이 존재하고 있음을 의미한다. 이제 노동조합의 근본 목표에 대한 성찰과 이를 통한 전통적인 임금정책으로의 회귀가 필요한 시점이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,서울시 자율주행차 주차수요 관리방안,,"In this study, the changes in urban traffic by autonomous driving technology are summarized. In particular, changes in parking behavior and parking facilities, which are most sensitive to changes from AV, are analysed. When autonomous vehicles are parked in an existing parking facility, the capacity of that parking facility increases by 30 ~ 60%. An AV exclusive parking garage can lead to a further 70% land use efficiency. In particular, the combination of a mechanical parking lot and autonomous driving technology can increase parking capacity by more than 75% and the land utilization rate by more than 14%.
Autonomous vehicles avoid crowded and expensive urban parking lots by sending deadhead back to home, or moving to nearby cheap parking lots. In an opinion poll about the usage of autonomous vehicles, 83.7% of existing passenger car drivers responded that they would switch to autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, 58.2% of users of public transportation responded that they would switch to autonomous vehicles. As a result of a poll related to the selection of a parking lot when going to the city center in an autonomous driving car, the choice of a parking lot outside the city center was the most common among passenger car users and public transportation users. It was also found that 21 ~ 27% of respondents chose a parking lot in the city center, and that 8 ~ 12% answered that they returned their car to their home. Due to the demand for autonomous car parking, an additional VKT (Vehicle · km) of up to 4.7 million vehicles / km occurred, which is about 30.0% of the total driving distance of Seoul city (53,426,401 vehicles / km in 2014). In scenarios where a single fare is charged at a rate lower than the city center, a VKT of about 18.9 million vehicles / km, which is about 35% of the total driving distance of Seoul city, is added, and there is an increased travel distance of 31.9 km per vehicle as well.
Therefore, the management scope and characteristics of the existing traffic demand management policy were diagnosed in order to envision a demand management policy that reflects the characteristics of autonomous driving cars. This study proposes a demand management zoning system that selectively applies existing traffic management policies that are appropriate for each region’s traffic characteristics. The principle of “Zoning” for traffic demand management considering autonomous vehicles’ characteristics is as follows. As one enters the city center, it adopts a strong demand management policy and encourages the transfer from autonomous vehicles to public transportation in a variety of ways, including strengthening transfer facilities between modes. Area 1 of Jongno-gu, Jung-gu, Yeongdeungpo, and Jongno-gu, which are the targets of Zone 1, will be designated as special management zones, and a strong demand management policy will be implemented therein to limit vehicle entry by congestion tolls. In Zone 2, the “Kiss & Ride” method is applied to reduce the demand for autonomous vehicles to enter the city center. Autonomous vehicles drop passengers off and return to the low-cost parking lot or back home, and passengers then use public transportation. Zone 3 is the area coping with the demand of the wide-area traffic demand. Autonomous driving cars park in AV exclusive parking lot with low rates at the outskirts of the city, and drivers then use public transportation to their destination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이를 위해 간선급행버스법에 근거하여 BRT 구간에서 통행할 수 있는 차량이 무엇인지 검토한다. 그리고 BRT 구간에서 통행할 수 있는 권한이 없는 차량이 BRT 구간을 통행했을 때 발생하는 제재는 무엇인지 분석한다. 그리고 이를 통해 통행 권한 소지 여부가 불분명한 차량이 BRT에서 운행되는 경우 생기는 운행자의 리스크를 자율주행자동차 실증주체의 관점에서 분석한다. 그리고 이러한 규범적 리스크로 인해 발생할 수 있는 BRT 구간에서의 자율주행 실증 회피를 줄이기 위한 법제적 개선점을 제시한다. 이러한 방식으로 BRT 구간에서 자율주행 실증이 가능하다는 법령보충적 행정규칙인 고시를 제정할 필요성을 검토한다. 그리고 단순히 법령보충적 행정규칙인 고시를 제정하는 것을 넘어 상위 법령 차원에서 BRT 구간에서의 자율주행 허용이 명시적으로 규율될 필요가 있음을 논증한다.
BRT에서의 자율주행 실증을 위해 간선급행버스법 관련 법제 개선이 필요할 수 있다. 하지만 별도의 제도를 통해 BRT에서의 자율주행 실증이 가능하다면, 굳이 간선급행버스법과 관련된 제도를 개선하는 방식으로 BRT 구간에서의 자율주행 실증을 허용하지 않아도 크게 문제되는 것은 아니다. 다른 제도를 통한 BRT 구간에서의 자율주행 실증이 허용되는 경우 간선급행버스법 자체의 개선이 반드시 필요한 것은 아니기 때문이다. 따라서 BRT 구간에서 자율주행 실증을 허용할 수 있는 제도로 검토될 수 있는 기존 법제들을 검토한다. 특히 BRT에서의 자율주행 실증 허용은 실증특례에 해당할 수 있기 때문에, 자율주행실증과 관련하여 특례를 인정받을 수 있는 법제인 「규제자유특구 및 지역특화발전특구에 관한 규제특례법」, 「정보통신 진흥 및 융합 활성화 등에 관한 특별법」, 「산업융합 촉진법」 및 「자율주행자동차 상용화 촉진 및 지원에 관한 법률」을 검토한다. 이들 특별법에 따른 특례제도에도 불구하고 간선급행버스법제의 개선이 필요한 이유들을 살펴보기 위해 해당 법률의 제도들을 분석하고, 이를 토대로 간선급행버스 관련 법제 개선의 필요성을 논증한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그렇다면 4차 산업혁명은 과연 실재하는 시대적 패러다임인가? 형법에도 변화를 예고하는가? 4차 산업혁명이 비록 ‘혁명’과 같은 커다란 변혁을 예고하지는 않을지라도, 현재 알파고(AlphaGo)와 같은 인공지능은 다양한 영역, 특히 자동차산업에 자율주행자동차로 구현되고 있다. 그러나 현 기술은 약인공지능 단계로서, 약인공지능에 인간과 같은 자아가 결합된 강인공지능의 도래는 전문가들 조차도 회의적인 입장이 많다. 더욱이 인간은 인공지능이 결코 따라올 수 없는 ‘창의력’을 지닌 존재로서, 인공지능만 탑재된 로봇이 인간을 대체할 수는 없다.
정보기술의 발달은 경이로울 정도의 편리함을 주고 있으나, 2016년 알파고(AlphaGo)의 등장으로 다른 한편으로는 경악할 정도의 공포감도 가져다 주었다. 그러나 인간의 행위를 전제로 하는 형법에 있어서는 이러한 인공지능을 필두로 하는 4차 산업혁명은 아직 형법의 변화를 예고할 만큼 우리 앞에 놓인 것이 아니다. 따라서 형법을 통해 안전을 모색하고자 하는 안전형법은 그동안 논의해온 위험형법, 현대형법의 연장선에 그쳐야 한다. 이를 넘어 형법의 주요임무를 사회안전관리의 보장으로 상정한다면, 결국 과거 ‘경찰국가’와 유사한 형태로 자리잡을 가능성도 배제하지 못한다. 또한 형법은 규범학으로서 규범학은 과학기술을 선도할 수 없다. 새로운 발전을 목표로 하는 과학기술의 속성상 과학기술발전은 규범의 범주에 머무르지 않으며, 결국 규범이 과학기술을 쫓아갈 수 밖에 없다. 따라서 규범학 중에서도 가장 보수적이면서 보충성의 속성을 지닌 형법은 4차 산업혁명이라는 두려움에 지나치게 반응하기 보다는 현재의 위치에서 당면한 문제를 중심으로 하여 본연의 규범원칙 의미를 재고하여야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

두 책의 목표는 크게 두 가지로 볼 수 있다. 그 하나는 포스트휴먼 법학의 의의와 전망을 가늠해 보는 것이요, 다른 하나는 그 의의와 전망의 첫 사례이자 두드러진 사례로서 자율주행자동차를 둘러싼 법적 쟁점을 살펴보는 것이다. 하지만 여러 유익한 세부 논점들에도 불구하고, 두 책의 논의는 범위와 깊이 양면에서 제한적인 편이다. 포스트휴먼 규범학이라는 큰 그림 하에 포괄적인 작업이 이루어지지 않았고, 자율주행자동차의 법적 쟁점과 관련해서도 민사적 쟁점(특히 계약법적 쟁점 등), 지적재산권법적 쟁점 등이 제대로 다루어지지 않았다. 일부 거론된 헌법적 쟁점이나 손해배상 관련 쟁점 혹은 형사적 쟁점 역시 거기에 결부된 다양한 쟁점들이 망라되어 논의되지는 않았다. 그리고 각 주제들에 대해 본격적인 논의로 발전되지 못했다. 요컨대, 포스트휴먼 법학이라는 기획의 총론으로서든 각론으로서든, 두 책의 논의는 본격적이지도 자족적이지도 않은 단계에 있다고 하겠다.
하지만 두 책은 시론적 논집이라는 점에서, 이러한 제한점은 납득할 만하다. 그리고 본문에서 세밀하게 논평한 것처럼, 각각의 글들은 비록 수미일관되지 못했을지라도 학계와 실무계에 크고 작게 기여하는 점들이 있다. 그리하여 적어도 두 책은 여전히 해당 총서 시리즈의 출발로서 어떻게든 독자들에게 포스트휴먼 법학에 대한 관심을 불러일으키는 장(場)을 제공해 주고 있다. 이 점에서 두 책의 출간은 분명한 의의를 가진다고 생각되며, 두 책 이후에 발간될 총서에 대해서도 기대를 갖게 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

우버택시(Uber Taxi)는 공유경제(Sharing Economy)에서 출발한다. 생산된 자원을 공유하거나 교환하여 기존의 자원을 효율적으로 사용하는 경제모델이다. 글로벌 금융위기를 겪은후 과도한 소유권보다는 사용가치를 중시하자는 개념에서 유래한다. 이러한 세계적 추세와 최근 발달한 ICT를 기반으로 한 공유경제 플랫폼 기업이 우버다. 스마트 폰 앱을 이용한 우버택시 서비스는 시간(Door to Door)을 줄이고, 승차거부나 요금시비를 없앴다. 우버가 택시시장에 새로운 장을 연 것이다.
우버(Uberization)로 상징되는 이러한 혁명적 변화는 기존 산업구조를 흔들면서 많은 장점에도 불구하고 택시운송사업에 여러 가지 문제점을 야기하고 있다. 우버택시는 기존의 산업을 위협하지 않으면서 효율적으로 운영하는 데 그 목적이 있다. 그런데 현재 우리나라의 택시시장은 공급과잉의 상태에 있다. 또한 일반택시운송 종사자에게는 생존권 문제를, 우버택시운전자에게는 근로관계의 취약성을, 승객에게는 안전에 대한 우려를 야기하고 있다.
우버가 네트워크를 이용한 혁신적인 서비스를 제공한다 할지라도 자동차여객운수사업법 테두리 속에서 이루어져야 한다. 하지만 우버택시는 불법적인 요소를 포함하고 있다. 택시영업을 하기 위해선 택시면허와 영업면허를 가지고 있어야 한다. 우버는 우리나라에서 택시사업을 영위하면서 택시면허를 갖지 않은 자가용 차량이(우버엑스)나 렌터카(우버블랙)로 유상운송을하였다. 택시영업을 하기 위해선 면허를 취득한 운전자가 노란색 영업용 넘버가 달린 차량을이용하여 운행하여야 한다. 그리고 택시운전자는 현업에 종사하고 있는 택시기사여야만 한다.
우버가 운수사업법상의 면허를 취득하지 않은 이상 어떠한 형태의 영업이든 불법영업이다. 따라서 우버가 여객자동차운수사업면허를 취득하지 않은 채 이러한 사업을 영위하는 행위는 운수사업법상 무면허 행위로서 제재의 대상이 된다.
우버택시에 대한 규제를 면허문제로 금지하고 있지만 금지의 직접적인 이유는 기존 택시업계에 대한 경제적 이해 충돌로 보여진다. 이러한 새로운 시스템이 기존의 법과 제도에 의해서막힌다면 기술혁신과 소비자들에 대한 혜택을 줄이는 결과를 초래할 수 있다. 제도적 보완이필요하다고 본다. 본 논문에서는 우버택시의 정책상의 문제와 운수사업법상의 면허제도에 대해서 알아보도록 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그러나, 군인연금법과 공무원연금법의 취지와 적용요건은 다르다. 그리하여 공무원연금법에 의한 각종 수혜를 받았다고 하여 이 사례에서 관용차면책약관이 적용되기는 곤란하다.
그리고, 상법 제724조 제2항에 따라 피해자에게 인정되는 직접청구권의 법적 성질은 논란의 대상이다. 이에 대한 판결이 타당한가에 대해 상당한 의문이 제기된다. 인보험에서도 피보험이익이 요구되는가? 학설상 피보험이익을 요구하지 않는다고 해석하는 견해가 다수설이다. 생각하건대, 어떤 보험이든지 보험계약에 가입하려는 경우 금전상의 이익이 아니라도 일정한 이익의 상실에 대한 두려움 내지 위험에 대한 회피의식이 있을 것이다. 이를 피보험이익으로 구성함이 우리 법에서도 바람직하다고 생각한다. 준거법인 영국법이 그러한 태도이다. 그리고 본 사례 중 상해보험에서의 특별약관 규정에 의하면 태아가 이 상해보험계약의 피보험자로 되기 어렵다. 다만, 피고 B의 주장과 같이 이 상해보험계약에 관해 약관 또는 보험자와 보험계약자의 개별 약정으로 태아를 상해보험의 피보험자로 할 수 있다면 이는 별개이다. 어떤 보험약관의 기재내용은 특별약관의 내용을 당사자의 의사에 의하여(사적 자치) 변경한 것으로 해석할 여지를 주고 있다. 그리고, 어떤 약관에 의하는가에 따라 보험회사의 대위권 포기 여부가 결정되는 사례도 있다. 대법원은 이 사례에서 보험자 대위의 범위를 가급적 좁게 해석하고자 한다. 대법원의 이와 같은 판단에는 합리적인 이유가 어느 정도 있지만 몇 가지 결함이 있다. 특히 일반약관과 별도로 특별약관을 두고 있다면 우선 특별약관의 적용이 우선되어야 한다. 만약 이 사례에서 특별약관이 배제된다고 본다면 피보험자의 이중 보상(보험금 보상과 대위권 행사의 보상)의 문제가 발생한다.
임원배상책임보험계약에서 특별약관으로 정한 면책약관은 그 해석을 엄격히 하여야 할 것이다. 그리하여 사례에서 피보험자인 회사가 자본시장법 위반죄로 기소되었다가 무죄판결이 선고·확정된 임원을 위하여 지출한 변호사보수에 상응하는 손해가 이 면책범위에는 포함될 수 없다.
과거의 실화책임에 관한 법률은 일반 불법행위에 대한 과실주의의 예외를 정하였다. 즉, 경과실로 인한 실화의 경우 실화피해자의 손해배상 청구권을 전면 부정하였다. 그러나, 이는 헌법재판소 결정에 의하여 헌법불합치·적용중지 판단을 받았다. 이에 따라 전부 개정된 현행 실화책임법이 적용되고 있다. 실화자의 책임을 전면 부정한 태도는 변경되어 그 책임의 감경을 청구할 수 있을 뿐이다. 앞으로는 실화의 경우 개정법의 태도에 맞추어 화재보험금을 지급한 보험자의 대위권 행사(상법 제682조), 책임보험제도 등이 운영되어야 할 것으로 본다.

2020,플랫폼운송기업과 카풀에 대한 규제,"공유경제, 승차공유, 플랫폼운송기업, 카풀, 우버,Sharing Economy, Ride Sharing, Platform Transport Company, Car Pool, Uber","카풀(Carpool)은 플랫폼을 이용하여 목적지나 방향이 같은 사람들이 자가용 승용차를 함께 타고 출퇴근시간에 이를 택시처럼 이용할 수 있는 승차공유 서비스다. 그런데 기존의 택시사업과 영역이 겹치는 여객운송시장에 플랫폼기업이 참여함으로써 논란이 불거지고 있다. 카풀 논란에 관련해서는 운수사업법 제81조 제1항 제1호의 ‘출퇴근 때’의 의미를 어떻게 해석할 것인가가 관건이다. 운수사업법은 자가용자동차를 유상으로 제공, 임대, 알선하는 행위를 금지하고 있다. 다만, ‘출퇴근 때’ 승용자동차를 함께 타는 경우에는 예외적으로 자가용자동차의 유상 제공, 임 대, 알선을 허용하고 있다. 하지만 ‘출퇴근 시간’이 정확히 언제부터 언제까지인가에 대한 구체적인 시행령이나 시행규칙이 뒷받침되지 않았다. 플랫폼운송기업이 카풀 서비스 시장에 뛰어든 것도 바로 이 틈새시장을 겨눈 것이다. 개정 운수사업법 제81조에서 카풀은 오전 7시에서 9시, 오후 6시에서 8시까지만 적법하게 서비스 를 할 수 있게 하였다. 운수사업법의 개정에 의하여 카풀의 시간이 정하여졌으나 앞으로도 논란은 계속될 것으로 보여 진다. 법이 제도적으로 뒷받침하는 것은 맞지만 출퇴근을 4시간으로 확정한 데 에는 문제가 있어 보인다. 본 논문에서는 플랫폼운송기업이 운영하고 있는 카풀의 운영방식과 그 범 위에 대하여 중점적으로 알아본다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,2017년 상법총칙?상행위법 판례의 동향과 분석 = Review and Study of the Court Cases concerning relating to General Principles of Commercial Law and Commercial Transaction Law during 2017,"Transfer of Business,Foreclosure,Extinctive Prescription,Ancillary Commercial Activities,A Ban on Competition Business,The Trucking Business(‘Coupang Case’),묵시적 합의에 의한 영업양도,유질계약의 허용,분할승계회사의 연대채무의 소멸시효 기산점,보조적 상행위로 인한 채권의 소멸시효,영업양도인의 경업금지의무,화물자동차법상 유상운송사업","이 논문은 2017년 동안 내려진 상법총칙 및 상행위법에 관한 주요 판결을 정리하고 그 판시 내용을 분석한 것이다.
첫 번째 평석대상 대법원 판례는 영업임대차의 해지에 있어서 영업양도의 묵시적 합의가 있었다고 볼 수 있는가?를 살펴 상법 제42조 제1항의 적용여부를 판단한 사례이다. 이 사건에서 대법원은 당사자의 묵시적 합의에 의한 영업양도의 인정에 소극적인 종전의 태도를 견지하였는데, 원고가 영업양도의 인정 여부를 직접적으로 다투는 것 대신에 외관을 신뢰한 자신의 보호필요성을 설득하며 상법 제42조 제1항의 유추적용을 주장하였으면 승소가능성이 더 크지 않았을까 생각해본다.
두 번째 대법원 판례는 질권설정자가 상인이 아닌 경우에도 상법 제59조를 적용하여 유질약정의 효력을 인정할 수 있는가?가 주요 쟁점이 된 사건인데, 대법원은 일단 적용긍정설에 따라 사건을 마무리하였다. 다만 필자는 향후 대법원이 지속적으로 적용긍정설을 유지할지에 대하여 조심스런 태도를 취하였다. 왜냐하면 이 사건은 질권설정자가 주주이자 대표이사로서 자신 속한 회사의 채무를 위하여 자신의 보유주식에 질권을 설정하는 특수한 상황이었다는 점을 감안할 필요가 있기 때문이다.
세 번째와 네 번째 대법원 판례는 상행위로 인한 채권의 소멸시효에 관한 사례인데, 두 판례가 핵심적 쟁점에 있어서는 다르다. 세 번째 사건은 합병승계회사가 분할회사의 영업상 채권자에 대하여 부담하는 연대채무의 소멸시효의 기산점에 관한 판단이 이루어졌다. 분할승계회사의 연대채무는 그 성격상 분할회사의 채무와 동일하게 취급하여야 하므로 분할합병 등기일이 아니고 원래 채권의 변제기 즉 권리행사가능시점을 기산점으로 하여 시효가 진행되어야 한다는 대법원의 판단은 타당하다고 평가한다. 네 번째 사건은 원고의 채권이 보조적 상행위로 인한 채권이므로 상법 제64조의 본문이 적용되어 5년으로 소멸시효가 완성된다고 판시한 사례인데 이러한 판단은 종전의 판례는 물론이고 학계에서도 이견이 없는 것이다.
이 논문에는 하급심 판례 2개도 평석의 대상으로 삼았는데, 첫 번째 하급심 판례는 광주지방법원의 판결로 영업양도계약으로 인정되지 않아 피고에게 상법 제41조 제1항(영업양도인의 경업금지)의 적용이 부정된 사안인데, 영업양도 판단기준을 구체적으로 선정하고 이를 판단한 법원의 입장에 무리가 없다. 판시내용만으로는 다소 불명확하나 법원이 “당사자 사이에 경업을 용인하는 묵시적 합의가 있었다고 볼 여지”를 긍정하고 있어서, 설사 영업양도가 인정되었어도 피고에게 경업금지의무 위반을 묻는 데는 어려움이 있었던 사례로 보인다. 그리고 두 번째 하급심판례로 소위 ‘쿠팡사건’으로 불리는 서울중앙지법의 판결을 분석해보았다. 쿠팡사건은 현재 항소심이 진행되고 있는데 1심에서는 일단 피고인 쿠팡이 승소하였다. 쿠팡의 자가 화물자동차를 통한 운송행위(소위 ‘로켓배송’)는 상행위법상 운송계약의 구조나 화물자동차법상 유상운송사업의 개념 등을 분석해 볼 때 유상 운송사업으로 보기 어렵다는 법원의 판단은 논리의 합리성과 현실적 타당성의 측면에서 높은 점수를 주고 싶다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,자율주행차의 운행자성 및 운전자성 인정에 대한 시론(試論) = Legal Personality Issues relating to Autonomous Vehicle,"자율주행차, 운행자, 운전자, 민사책임, 법인격, 자동차보험, Autonomous Vehicle, Operator, Driver, Civil Liability, Legal Personality, Car Insurance","자율자동차의 경우 실제 운전이 사람의 개입 없이 자율주행시스템을 통해 이루어지므로 교통사고 방지를 위한 주의의무, 도로교통수칙 준수 의무 등은 사람이 아닌 자율주행차에 있다. 하지만, 현행 법체계하에서 자율주행차는 법인격을 가지고 있지 않기 때문에 자율주행차가 잠재적으로 일으킬 수 있는 불법행위, 위험에 대한 규제가 어렵다. 이에 따라, 자율주행차 관련 교통사고에 대한 책임배분 문제에 있어 운행자의 운행책임을 확장하는 방식 또는 제조사의 제조물책임을 확장하는 방식으로 책임법제 논의가 진행되고 있다. 그러나, 이러한 방식은 실제 운행에 개입하지 않은 운전자 또는 제조사에게 부당하게 과도한 책임을 부담시키는 등 불합리한 결과를 초래할 우려가 있다. 이 논문에서는 현재 진행되고 있는 자율주행차 관련 운행자성 인정 및 책임법제 논의를 우선 검토하고 그 한계점을 분석하였으며, 이러한 한계점을 극복하기 위해 자율주행차에 대한 운행자성 또는 운전자성을 인정하는 것이 가능한지 여부에 대해 시론(試論)적 분석을 진행하였다. 또한, 자율주행차에 탑승한 인간운전자의 운행자성 또는 운전자성 부정 가능성도 함께 검토하였다. 이 논문에서 다룬 자율주행차에 대한 운행자성 또는 운전자성 인정을 통한 법인격 부여 가능여부 논의가 현행 책임법제의 한계를 보완할 수 있는 새로운 책임법제 마련을 위한 논의의 시작점이 될 수 있기를 기대한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,자율주행차 사고와 제조물책임 : ADS Entity 등의 제조업자로서의 책임 = Automated Vehicle Accident and Product Liability : ADS Entity’s Liability as a Product Manufacturer,"자율주행자동차,자율주행시스템(ADS),제조물책임,제조상 결함,설계상 결함,표시상 결함,Automated Vehicle,Automated Driving System,Product Liability,Manufacturing Defect,Design Defect,Warning Defect","이 글에서는 먼저 자율주행차 사고가 발생한 경우 피해자인 원고가 제작자에 대해 제조물책임을 추궁할 유인이 있는지 여부에 대해 살펴보았다. 자율주행자동차 혹은 ADS도 “제조물”이기 때문에 제조물책임은 그 제작자에 대해 당연히 적용되지만, 실제 피해자가 제조물책임을 추궁할 가능성은 낮아 보인다. 왜냐하면 피해자의 입장에서는 사실상 무과실책임으로 운영되는 보유자의 운행자책임을 추궁할 수 있기 때문에 결함의 증명책임을 부담하는 제조물책임을 추궁할 유인이 작기 때문이다. 특히, ADS의 운전작업시 ADS 대신 운전자책임을 지는 ADS Entity 개념을 도입하는 경우, 피해자는 자율주행정보기록장치를 통해 ADS의 운전을 증명할 수 있고, 이 경우 ADSE의 운전자책임이 추정되므로, ADSE의 운전자책임을 추궁할 유인이 더 크다. 하지만, 운행자책임을 지는 자율차보유자가 피해자에 대해 일차적 책임을 지는 경우, 피해자에게 손해배상을 한 보유자의 보험회사는 제조물책임을 추궁할 가능성이 높다. 즉 자율주행차 사고가 자율주행차량 혹은 ADS의 결함에 기인한 때에는, 피해자에게 손해를 배상한 자율차 보유자의 보험회사는 자율주행차량의 제작자 혹은 ADS의 제작자에 대해 그 결함 때문에 손해가 발생했음을 주장하면서 구상을 위한 손해배상소송을 제기할 가능성이 높기 때문이다.
다음으로, 과실 혹은 무과실책임인 운전자책임, 운행자책임과 달리 결함책임 구조를 갖는 제조물책임의 구조 및 제조물책임의 책임주체인 제조업자 및 표시제조업자의 개념에 대해 살펴보고, ADS 제작자 혹은 자율차 제작자가 이러한 제조업자가 될 수 있다고 결론을 내렸다. 또한 제조물책임의 성립요건인 “제조물의 결함”에 대해 살펴보았는데, 자율주행차 사고가 ADS의 결함으로 발생한 경우 제조물책임이 성립될 수 있음을 살펴보았다.
마지막으로 자율주행차의 결함과 관련해 (i) 제조상의 결함, (ii) 설계상의 결함, (iii) 표시상의 결함 및 (iv) 통상적 안정성의 결여 등의 관점에서 각 결함의 증명책임 및 결함의 추정과 한계에 대해 살펴보고 개별 쟁점들에 대해 검토하였다. 먼저, 제조상의 결함과 관련해, 결함의 추정이 규정되어 있으나 통상성의 입증 등에 있어 추정상의 한계가 있다는 점 등을 살펴보았다. 두 번째, 설계상의 결함과 관련해, 자율주행차와 관련된 합리적 대체설계의 의미와 합리성의 판단기준인 소비자기대기준, 위험효용기준의 적용방법에 대해 살펴보았다. 마지막으로, 표시상의 결함과 관련해 합리적인 표시가 무엇인지, 제작자에 의한 자동화단계의 부여 혹은 작동설계영역의 제한이 표시상의 결함과 관련해 어떤 의미가 있는지 등에 대해 살펴보았다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study analyzed the effects of EV expansion on both renewable energy variability and power system flexibility. The scenarios were based on the combined modeling for the electric and transport sector. As a result of modeling, EV expansion has contributed significantly to reducing curtailment. The RE20% (Renewable Energy Power Generation Share 20%) scenario did not result in curtailment when EV reached 3 million units. The RE30% Scenario showed that EV reached 7 million units or other ESS technologies should be applied together to reduce curtailment significantly. This modeling considered smart charging. In reality, other charging types are more common than smart charging. Various institutional devices and polices will be needed to realize that. In addition, it will be necessary to study the unique characteristics of transportation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

법원의 사법적 판단은 사실상 약관에 대한 사법적 규제에 해당하기 때문에 사적자치의 대 전제에 대한 강력한 통제이자 제재가 된다. 따라서 법원은 분쟁금액이 소액일지라도 관련 법리에 좇아 정치한 판결이 될 수 있도록 노력해야 한다. 그런데 최근 자기부담금과 관련된 항소심 판결들은 상당한 문제를 안고 있다. 우선 자차보험은 보험계약자가 야기한 교통사고, 즉 본인 과실에 의한 자차(自車)의 손해를 담보하기 위한 것으로 대물배상으로 보상되지 않는 부분까지 전보받기 위해 가입하는 보험이다. 그리고 자차보험을 가입하면서 사고로 인한 손해액(수리비 등)의 일부를 보험회사가 아닌 계약자 본인이 부담하도록 하는 제도가 바로 자기부담금이다. 이러한 자기부담금제도는 보험가입자의 입장에서 보면 손해발생시 자기가 부담할 몫이 되고, 보험회사의 입장에서는 발생한 손해액 중 보험가입자가 부담하기로 한 몫을 공제하기 때문에 ‘공제제도(Deductible)’라고 할 수 있다.
자차보험을 가입하면서 자기부담금을 약정하는 취지는 보험계약자의 보험료 절감과 보험회사의 손해사정 비용 절감 및 도덕적 위험을 방지하기 위한 것인데 이러한 취지는 자기부담금을 보험계약자 본인이 부담할 경우에만 달성될 수 있다. 따라서 자차보험을 처리하면서 보험계약자가 부담한 자기부담금을 ‘미보전(보상받지 못한) 손해’로 파악해서는 안 되고 오히려 손해보험계약상 보험계약자가 보험회사에 대해 부담하는 ‘계약상의 책임(채무)’이자 보험회사에게는 ‘책임제한사유’에 해당하는 것으로 이해하는 것이 타당하다. 향후 판례의 변경을 기대해 본다.
아울러 약관의 해석과 관련된 문제의 해결을 위해서는 법원의 사법적 규제에 앞서 금융감독 당국의 사전 행정지도 등을 통해서 약관의 개정 주체인 보험회사가 선제적으로 관련 약관을 변경·개정하는 절차를 밟는 조치를 하도록 유도한다면 약관해석과 관련된 분쟁을 최소화할 수 있고 나아가 보험소비자 보호에도 기여를 할 수 있을 것이다.
끝으로 자기부담금과 관련된 분쟁의 소지를 없애기 위해서는 관련 문구를 개별 약관에 보다 상세히 명시하는 방법으로 약관을 보완해 보험실무상의 혼란을 사전적으로 제거할 필요가 있다. 구체적인 약관개정 방법은 자차보험의 지급보험금 계산조항에 자기부담금의 부담 주체와 쌍방과실사고의 경우 선처리 보험회사의 대위권 취득범위를 명확히 하는 내용을 신설할 것을 제안한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,고지의무의 제척기간과 통지의무 위반 - 무역보험의 논의를 포함하여 -,"고지의무, 통지의무, 제척기간, 무역보험, 중요한 사항, 이륜차 운전, 정보비대칭,disclosure duty, notification duty, exclusion period, trade insurance, material facts, drive of two wheeled motor vehicles, information asymmetry",보험계약법에서 핵심을 이루는 이론이 고지의무이다. 세계 주요 국가들은 고지의무제도를 수 동적 답변의무화하였고 또 그 위반의 효과를 알려주도록 하는 내용을 규정하는 경우도 있다. 그런데 근래에는 같은 중요한 사항을 알리도록 하는 고지의무와 위험변경증가의 통지의무의 관계도 경합적으로 문제되는 사례가 등장하고 있다. 이륜차를 계약전에 운전하고 있는데 계약 시 알리도록 하는 것은 고지의무이다. 그런데 계약전에는 이륜차를 운전하지 않다가 계약 이 후에 이륜차를 운전하면 위험변경증가 통지의무가 문제된다. 그런데 계약 전?후에 걸쳐 이륜 차를 운전한 경우에 이를 어떻게 법리적으로 처리할 것인지가 문제인 것이다. 고지의무와 위 험증가 통지의무는 국제무역거래와 관련한 비상위험과 신용위험을 담보하는 무역보험에서도 같이 규정을 하고 있다. 그리고 무역보험도 민영보험의 원리를 준용하고 있다. 따라서 무역보 험 분야에서도 고지의무와 통지의무의 경합 문제가 발생할 수 있다. 객관적으로 보험계약 체 결 전후로 이륜자동차를 운전하였는데 고지의무를 위반하였고 통지의무도 위반한 경우 계약 체결후 3년이 지나면 고지의무위반은 제척기간이 도과되어 문제제기를 할 수 없는지가 핵심 쟁점이다. 이 사례에서 피보험자측에서 주장하는 바로서 통지의무위반을 보험자가 알고도 1월 동안 문제 삼지 않았다는 주장도 하고 있다. 만일 사실확인 결과 이것이 사실이면 통지의무위 반은 문제삼을 수 없고 고지의무위반도 제척기간이 도과되어 보험금을 지급하여야 할 것이다. 이 부분은 보다 명확한 사실관계 확인이 필요하다. 사실 확인 결과 보험자 측에서 알고서도 1월내 통지의무 위반으로 계약을 해지 하지 않은 것이 아닌 것으로 판명이 나면 통지의무 위 반으로 계약을 해지하고 보험금지급을 거절할 수 있다고 보아야 한다. 비록 고지의무는 제척 기간이 도과되었다고 하더라도 통지의무위반은 유효하게 주장할 수 있다고 보아야 한다. 보험 계약자가 고지의무와 통지의무를 다 위반하고도 고지의무 제척기간 도과의 이익만을 주장하 는 것은 적합하지 않다고 보기 때문이다. 고지의무를 위반하여 보험자는 위험요인을 알지 못 한 상태에서 고지의무 제척기간 도과를 이유로 통지의무위반도 문제 삼을 수 없다고 하면 보 험자와 보험계약자의 정보의 불균형을 시정할 기회를 봉쇄하는 것이기 때문이다. 보험자와 보 험계약자 사이의 정보비대칭을 시정하기 위하여서는 고지의무를 위반한 상태에서 제척기간 3년이 지났다고 하여도 위험증가 통지의무를 가지고 보험자는 대처할 수 있어야 할 것이다. 그를 통해 보험자와 보험계약자의 정보의 비대칭 관계를 해소할 수 있다. 이륜자동차 운전은 보험계약의 체결 및 유지에서 중요한 사항이다. 따라서 그를 고지하여야 한다. 고지의무위반 을 하고 3년이 지났다고 하여 위험증가 통지의무를 가지고 문제 제기를 하고 보험자가 계약해 지 등의 대응조치를 취할 수 있다고 보아야 한다. 그리고 이는 보험자가 그 위험증가 사실을 안날로부터 1월내에만 가능하다.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,"광주형 일자리의 의의, 쟁점과 과제",,"한국 경기가 좀처럼 침체의 늪을 벗어나지 못하며 고용시장 사정도 크게 나아지지 못하고 있습니다. 일각에서 고용절벽 문제를 해결할 대안으로 지난 1월말 노사민정 간 극적으로 타결된 <사회통합형 광주형 일자리>를 꼽고 있습니다. 광주형 일자리는 지역공동체 구성원들 간 협력을 통해 <지역 일자리>를 창출한다는 점에서 의미있는 시도이기 때문입니다.

  정부는 광주형 일자리를 모델로 삼아 <상생형 지역 일자리> 확산에 나섰고 지자체들의 관심도 뜨겁습니다. 현재 ‘군산형 일자리’, ‘구미형 일자리’를 비롯, 여러 지역차원에서 일자리 모델을 개발하는 움직임이 활발하게 진행 중입니다. 즉 <광주형일자리>는 지역 일자리정책의 마중물이이 될 수 있다는 점에서 중요한 의미를 가집니다.

  물론 광주형일자리에 대한 지역사회에서 반발이나 비판 및 논쟁점도 존재합니다. 이미 과포화상태인 자동차시장에 새로운 공장이 신설되면 기존노동자들의 노동환경을 악화시킬 거라는 우려를 비롯, 이번 합의에 노동권을 제약할 수 있는 양보 조항이 포함되었다는 비판도 있습니다.

  이번 4월호 <노동N이슈>에서는 <광주형 일자리 창출 모델>에 대해 초기부터 연구를 수행하며 정책추진을 위해 전문가로서 주요 역할을 수행했던 한국노동연구원의 박명준 연구위원의 글을 소개합니다.

  박명준 위원은 <광주형 일자리>가 단순히 일자리 양이 늘어나는 것을 훨씬 뛰어넘는, 획기적이고 파격적인 노동형태를 창출하는 사회통합적 노사관계 모델이라고 강조합니다. 일부 우려나 비판에 대해서도, 광주형일자리는 한국자동차산업과 자본의 혁신을 도모할 수 있도록 조건을 만들어내고 있으며, 적정 연봉과 사회임금을 지급받는 미래형 일자리가 될 수 있다는 점에서 의미가 있다고 설명합니다. 나아가 광주형일자리를 비롯해 여러 지방정부의 <상생형 지역 일자리>가 노동자들에게 이득이 될 수 있도록 노동조합의 건설적이고 창조적인 역할을 요구하고 있습니다.

2018,법정이율 인하가 손해보험에 미치는 영향,,"□ 현행 『민법』은 다른 법률의 규정이나 당사자 간의 약정이 없는 채권에 대한 이율을 연 5%로 정하고 있음(1958년 2월 민법 제정 시 정해진 이래 현재까지 유지됨)
□ 그러나 2016년에는 3년 만기 국채가 1.44%의 금리로 발행되었고 최근 신용등급이 높은 회사채도 4% 이하의 금리로 발행되고 있어 현행 법정이율(연 5%)과 시장금리 간에 괴리가 존재함
□ 법정이율이 시장금리보다 높아 채권자(개인 또는 법인)가 채무변재 청구를 고의로 뒤늦게 하는 문제와 대인 사고 피해자가 미래상실소득을 복구하는 데 충분한 손해배상금을 지급받지 못하는 문제가 발생함
ㆍ 법정이율이 미래상실소득의 할인율로 사용되기 때문에 5%의 할인율로 계산된 손해배상금의 현재가치 금액이 시장에 투자될 경우, 투자금액이 손해배상금보다 적어짐
□ 일본과 영국은 이러한 문제를 해소하기 위해 최근 대인사고 손해배상의 미래상실소득 할인율을 인하하였고 우리나라에서도 법정이율 인하 및 변동제 등의 내용을 포함한 민법 개정안이 발의되었음
□ 미래상실소득 할인율(법정이율)이 5%에서 3%로 인하될 경우 미래상실소득의 현재가치가 크게 증가함
ㆍ 월 소득 500만 원인 피해자가 30년간 일을 하지 못하게 된 경우 미래상실소득의 현재가치는 2억 6,070만 원 증가함(9억 3,141만 원 → 11억 9,211만 원, <표 2> 참조)
□ 최근 미래상실소득 할인율을 인하한 영국·일본은 관련 보험의 손해율 악화와 보험료 인상을 예상했음

  대법원은 부당이득반환청구권의 소멸시효에 대하여 신속하게 해결할 필요 여부를 기준으로 소멸시효를 다르게 적용하고 있지만, 이 기준이 타당하냐는 문제가 있다. 대법원은 자동차손해배상보장사업을 위탁받은 보험사업자가 부당이득반환청구권을 행사하는 경우 이 사업은 피해자에 대한 신속한 보상을 주목적으로 하는 것은 아니므로, 민사시효가 적용된다고 판결하였지만, 자동차손해배상보장법의 취지를 신속하고 효율적으로 피해자를 보호하려는 것으로 볼 필요가 있다. 이러한 시각에서 본다면 민사시효가 적용된다는 대법원판결의 법리에 대하여 재검토할 필요가 있다. 보증보험계약에 근거한 부당이득반환청구권에 관한 사건에서 대법원은 채권 발생의 경위나 원인, 원고와 피고의 지위와 관계 등에 비추어 신속하게 해결할 필요성 여부를 판단하였다. 그러나 분양계약에 근거한 부당이득반환청구권에 관한 사건에서 대법원은 선례와는 달리 원고와 피고의 지위와 관계에 관한 언급 없이 신속하게 해결할 필요성 여부를 판단하였다. 원고들은 사회적으로 열악한 지위에 있는 다수의 서민이지만, 피고는 자본금 규모가 35조원인 대규모공사이므로, 원고와 피고의 지위라는 시각에서 본다면 부당이득반환청구권에 관한 법률관계에 대해서 상사시효를 적용한 대법원판결에 대해서는 비판의 여지가 있다.
  거래에 관여하는 자들이 자신의 권리나 의무에 대하여 민사시효가 적용되는지 상사시효가 적용되는 지를 판단하기 어려워 분쟁이 발생하는 경우가 적지 않다. 이러한 상황에서 어떤 법을 적용하느냐에 따라 소멸시효를 다르게 적용하는 것은 시효제도를 통한 법적 안정성의 도모라는 소멸시효제도의 취지에 반하게 된다. 따라서 입법론적 시각에서 본다면 민사시효와 상사시효를 구별하지 아니하고 통일적으로 시효를 적용하는 것이 타당하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이러한 문제점을 바탕으로 소비자의 권익을 보호하기 위해서 이 글은 차량공유 및 승차공유의 법적 성격을 알아보고 플랫폼 운영자의 지위와 의무를 검토한다. 또한, 소비자의 피해를 구제하는 방안에 대하여 우리나라의 구제수단 외에 유럽의 구제수단을 검토한 뒤, 플랫폼에 대한 입법방안을 제시한다. 특히, 최근 입법된 여객자동차 운수사업법 일부개정법률안의 내용을 검토하고 이와 관련된 국내외의 판결문을 검토한다. 이를 통해 플랫폼 운영자의 계약상 지위와 책임을 구체화한다. 플랫폼이 소비자와 공급자 간 거래에 개입하는 정도에 따라서 계약의 당사자는 계약의 법적 성격을 달리 판단할 수밖에 없을 것이며, 플랫폼 역시 그에 상응하는 법적 책임을 부담하게 될 것이다. 소비자의 구제방안 역시 이를 전제로 수립되어야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,1929년 조선박람회에 활용된 경성의 교통망 = The Traffic Network of Gyeongseong Used for the Chosun Exhibition in 1929,"조선박람회,박람회장(경복궁),조선철도,경성역,전차,박람회선,경성관광,교외명소,The Chosun Exhibition,exhibition venue (Gyeongbokgung Palace),Chosun Railway,Gyeongseong Station,trams,exhibition routes,Gyeongseong tour,suburban tourist attractions","이 글은 1929년 식민지 도시 경성에서 열린 조선박람회 기간 동안, 경성의 교통망이 어떻게 활용되었는지를 살펴본 것이다. 조선총독부는 市政20년을 기념하는 박람회에서 성공적인 개최를 위해 최대한 많은 관람객을 동원하려고 하였다. 이를 위해 조선을 넘어 일본과 만주 등지에 흩어져 있는 관람객들을 박람회장으로 집합시키는 것은 중요한 문제였다. 이때 활용된 것이 조선의 간선철도와 경성의 시내교통인 전차였다.
  조선박람회는 9월 12일부터 10월 31일까지 50일 동안 총독부 신청사 뒤편의 경복궁과 신무문 밖 부지 10만 평에 마련되었다. 이 기간 동안 박람회를 관람한 인원은 유료 입장자만 98만 명으로 집계되었다. 이들 중 대다수는 철도를 이용하여 경성으로 이동했는데, 조선총독부 철도국은 관람객들이 단기간에 집중될 것을 우려하여 박람회 개최에 앞서 〈조선박람회관람단체수송신청서〉를 접수받았다. 각 지역에서 단체관람객을 모집한 협찬회가 소속 부청과 군청, 도청과 승차역에 신청서를 제출하였고, 이를 통해 철도국은 단체관람객의 철도편을 통제할 수 있었다. 박람회 시찰단들은 주로 밤기차를 타고 경성에 도착하였다. 이렇게 밤기차가 활용된 것은 초행길에 길 찾기가 좋고, 경제적으로도 유익하기 때문이었다. 이때 가장 많은 관람객이 모인 철도역은 경인선과 경부선, 경의선과 호남선 등이 만나는 경성역이었다.
  당시 경성에는 전차와 부영버스가 운행하고 있었지만 주된 시내교통은 전차였다. 경성전기(주)는 전차의 박람회 노선을 편성하여 철도역과 박람회장을 연결하였다. 박람회 개최에 앞서 경복궁 주변으로 전차궤도가 신설되고 복선화되는 등 전차의 도심노선도 이때 완성되었다.
  박람회 관람을 위해 상경한 사람들은 최소 3일에서 4일을 경성에서 보냈다. 이들은 하루 정도 박람회장을 둘러보고 경성관광에 나섰다. 총독부 철도국은 관람객을 대상으로 조선의 역사와 문화를 감상하면서 일본의 식민통치가 이룬 성과를 확인하는 관광코스를 개발하였다. 이와 달리 『조선박람회안내』에는 옛 조선의 문화 유적을 기억하며 식민지가 된 조선의 변화상을 살펴보는 관광코스가 제시되었다. 교외에서는 도성 밖의 청량리와 왕십리, 마포, 양화진 등이 추천 명소로 꼽혔다. 이렇게 경성관광과 교외로의 이동은 시내교통인 전차를 중심으로 이루어졌고, 부영버스와 경인버스, 대절자동차, (당인리행) 철도 등도 함께 활용되었다.
  1929년 조선박람회는 일본과 만주 등에서도 관람객이 동원된 대규모 이벤트였다. 이미 간선철도망을 갖춘 조선철도는 박람회 기간 동안 경성으로 관람객들을 집중시켰고, 시내교통인 전차도 관람객들을 박람회장으로 이동시켰다. 이렇게 박람회에 활용된 철도교통과 시내교통은 경성의 철도역에서 연계되었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이러한 전제에서 기업민주화 및 기업의 사회적 책임의 실현방안을 제시하였다. 대기업은 공정한 기업지배구조를 확립해야 할 사회적 책임을 부담한다고 본다. 또한 그간에 사외이사제도를 비롯한 민주적인 기업지배구조의 정착을 위한 노력이 필요하다. 지배주주의 견제를 위한 사외이사제도가 성공하기위해서는 정부가 추진 중인 집중투표제의 의무화, 감사위원의 분리선출, 전자투표의 강제실시, 노동이사제 등의 제도를 각 개별기업의 현실이 허락하는 범위 내에서 순차적으로 도입하여야 한다. 민주주의는 정치영역의 전유물일 수는 없다. 경제와 기업영역에서의 민주주의도 반드시 실현되어야 한다. 또한 최근 광주시와 현대자동차 및 지역협력업체가 공동출자하여 설립을 시도하고 있는 자동차생산법인과 같은 대기업과 중소기업의 협력모델을 적극적으로 개발할 필요가 있다. 정부에서는 이러한 대기업의 횡포를 방지하기 위하여 공정거래법, 하도급법 등의 시행을 통하여 규제를 강화하고 있다. 그러나 이러한 법률의 규제만으로 대기업에 기울어진 운동장을 바로 잡는 것은 한계가 있다.
그러므로 대기업 중소기업 및 노동자의 상생형 일자리구조를 설계할 필요가있다.
또한 기업의 사회적 책임에 관한 일반규정의 신설이 필요하다. 기업의 사회적 책임에 관한 일반규정의 신설로 기업의 개념에 관한 획기적인 변화를 기대할 수 있다. 기업의 목적은 사회발전을 위하여 새로운 상품과 서비스의 창조에 있으며 이윤은 그러한 인류발전을 위한 창조에 대한 대가이다. 인류발전을위한 창조에 성공한 기업은 존속할 수 있으나 진부한 상품과 서비스에 고착된기업은 도태되는 것이 기업의 현실이다. 기업이 그 목적수행에 기여한 지분에상응하는 분배를 하지 않는다면 그 자체가 정의와 진리에 반하는 것이고 또하나의 적폐에 불과할 것이다.

2018,4차 산업혁명시대의 망 중립성 정책의 변화방향- EU와 미국의 변화를 중심으로 - = The Change of Network Neutrality Policy in the Fourth Industrial Revolution - Focusing on the Change of EU and U.S.A.,"망 중립성(Network Neutrality),4차 산업혁명(the Fourth Industrial Revolution),제로레이팅(Zero-Rating),비차별의무(Non-discrimination Obligation),특수서비스(Specialised Service),관리형 서비스(Managed Service),기간통신사업자(Common Carrier),전기통신사업법(Telecommunications Business Act)","망 중립성은 인터넷망 사업자에게 공익적 지위를 부여함으로써 경쟁제한성 등 별도의 위법성 사유를 입증하지 않고도 인터넷망 사업자의 차별적 행위를 규제하기 위해 고안된개념이다. 물론 망 중립성은 인터넷이라는 새로운 언론의장에서 중앙의 통제 없이 단대단으로 커뮤니케이션이 가능하도록 함으로써 표현의 자유를 수호하는 수단이 된다는 점에서 경제적 측면 이외에 중요한 정치적 의미를 가지고 있기도 하다.
최근 다양한 콘텐츠와 애플리케이션의 출시로 인하여 인터넷 트래픽이 급증하고 인터넷망 사업자의 망 증설에 따른부담이 심화되자, 망 중립성 원칙에 대한 도전이 시작되고있다. 2017년 미국의 트럼프 정부는 인터넷망 사업자를 기간통신사업자가 아니라 정보서비스 사업자로 다시 분류함으로써 차별금지의 원칙이나 차단금지 원칙 등과 같은 기존의강력한 사전규제에서 벗어나도록 하였다. 또한 미국과 달리망 중립성을 도입함에 있어서 신중하였던 EU는 이보다 앞선 2015년 망 중립성 규칙을 제정하면서 처음부터 우선적트래픽 처리 등 특별한 관리가 가능한 특수서비스의 개념을인정하고 있다. 우리나라의 2011년 망 중립성 가이드라인에서도 EU와 유사하게 관리형 서비스의 가능성을 인정하고있기는 하지만 구체적으로 어떠한 경우가 해당하는 것인지에 대해서는 분명한 입장을 밝히고 있지 않다.
4차 산업혁명시대에는 원격진료나 자율주행자동차 등 트래픽 지연이 발생하면 안 되는 특수한 서비스들과 대용량트래픽을 발생시키는 특정한 서비스들이 나타나고 있다. 그러나 기존의 엄격한 망 중립성 원칙을 적용하는 경우에는콘텐츠 또는 애플리케이션 간 어떠한 차별도 허용되지 않기때문에, 새로운 서비스들에 대한 특별한 관리가 불가능하다.
그러므로 4차 산업혁명의 발전을 위해서는 우선 이러한 서비스를 관리형 서비스의 개념에 포함시켜 별도의 요금체계를 적용하고 망 중립성의 엄격한 적용을 배제할 필요가 있다. 그리고 이와 같은 내용을 방송통신위원회의 망 중립성가이드라인에 포함시켜 사업자들에게 구체적인 정책적 방향을 제시할 필요가 있다. 그러나 포털서비스와 검색서비스등 일반적인 인터넷 접속 서비스에 대해서는 인터넷이라는공간이 수호해 온 표현의 자유를 보호하기 위해 지금까지의 망 중립성 원칙이 그대로 적용되도록 할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,사물인터넷(IoT) 범죄에 대한 형사법적 해결을 위한 제언 = The Criminal Regulation of Internet of Things(IoT) Crime,"사물인터넷 범죄,해킹,정보보호,구성요건적 고의,미수범,예비죄,IoT Crime,Hacking,Security of information,Intention,An Attempted Crime,the Preparation","사물인터넷이란 인터넷을 활용하여 사람과 사물을 연결하고, 나아가 각종 사물이 서로 통신하고 정보를 공유하게 하여 범세계적인 인간-사물 네트워크를 구축하는 개념을 지칭한다. 사물인터넷의 작동구조는 일반 컴퓨터 네트워킹에 비해 확대되어 있고 게이트웨이 단말이 저사양이라 해킹이 주된 위협요소가 되므로 사물인터넷 활용분야가 매우 넓은 만큼 범죄의 증가도 예상된다.
범죄를 예방하기 위해서는 우선 기술적인 보완이 필요할 것이며, 규범적인 대응방향으로서는 현행법상 정보보호를 위한 법들에 의해 보호받고 있다. 하지만 이러한 법률들이 사물인터넷을 이용한 2차적 범죄까지 규율하고 있는 것은 아니다. 물론 2차적 범죄는 형법 및 특별형법 등으로 처벌이 가능하겠지만 사물인터넷 범죄가 발생하지 않도록 사전에 예방하는 것이 중요하다. 따라서 사물인터넷 범죄의 발단인 해킹에 대한 처벌뿐만 아니라 미수범의 처벌, 나아가 해킹 예비죄 처벌도 검토해볼 필요가 있다. 그리고 사물인터넷이 2차적 범죄를 위한 수단으로 이용되는 이상 이와 관련하여 처벌의 공백이 발생할 수 있는 부분을 염두에 두고 새로운 구성요건의 신설을 검토해 보아야 한다. 예컨대, IP카메라나 카메라가 장착된 드론 등을 이용한 사생활 침해 범죄를 취급하기 위한 구성요건을 신설하거나, 사물인터넷을 이용한 범죄의 경우 위험한 물건을 휴대한 특수폭행 내지 특수상해죄의 해석상 따라오는 문제를 해결하기 위하여 위험한 물건의 ‘휴대’를 ‘이용하여’ 또는 ‘사용하여’로 개정하는 것이 필요하다.
그리고 사물인터넷 범죄는 해킹을 전제로 하므로 정보통신망법과 정보통신기반 보호법이 적용되는 경우가 많다. 특히 정보통신기반 보호법이 적용되는 경우에는 해킹행위 자체를 미수범으로 취급하고 있으므로 정작 해킹행위에 대한 미수범을 처벌할 수 없는 문제도 발생한다. 즉, 정보통신망법상 해킹행위는 미수범 처벌규정이 있는 반면 정보통신기반 보호법상의 해킹행위는 미수범 처벌규정이 없다. 이러한 문제를 해결하려면 동법상의 해킹행위를 기수범의 형태로 개정하고 이에 대한 미수범 처벌규정을 신설하는 것이 타당하다.
나아가 자율주행자동차의 교통사고 발생 시 탑승자에게 과실책임을 물을 수 있는지 문제된다. 교통사고처리특례법이나 도로교통법에서는 ‘운전자’라고 규정되어 있는데, ‘운전자’의 범주에 자율주행자동차의 탑승자를 포섭하여 해석하는 것이 어려우므로 법률의 개정이 필요하다. 마지막으로 사물인터넷을 이용한 2차적 범죄발생에 있어서 경우에 따라 구성요건적 고의의 인정여부가 문제될 소지가 있다. 사물인터넷 범죄는 네트워크를 통해 이루어지는 경우가 많아 범죄의 객체 대한 사실상의 인식이 있는 경우는 상정하기 어렵다. 따라서 고의의 내용을 구성하고 있는 ‘인식’에 대한 해석을 다시금 재고해볼 필요가 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

민사법상의 책임법리를 각각 구분하여 살펴보았다. 우선 제조물책임법상의 제조물에 해당하는지에 대해 검토해 보았으나, 인공지능로봇을 제조물로 보기에는 무리가 있다.
둘째, 사용자책임의 적용이 가능한가에 대해서 살펴보았다. 그러나 인공지능 로봇을 피용자로 볼 수 없으므로 사용자책임의 적용대상이 되지 않는 것으로 보아야 할 것이다.
셋째, 공작물의 점유자 및 소유자책임의 적용이 가능한가에 대해서 살펴보았다. 인공지능 로봇은 공작물로 볼 수 없으므로, 공작물의 점유자 및 소유자책임은 적용될 여지가 없어 보인다.
넷째, 동물의 점유자책임의 적용에 대해서 살펴보았다. 동물은 이성에 의한 제어를 받지 않는 자의적·본능적 행동을 할 수 있는 존재이고, 인공지능 로봇의 경우도 자기 스스로 학습하고 판단한 바에 따른 행동을 할 수 있다는 점에서 유사점을 찾을 수 있으므로 동물점유자의 책임에 관한 규정의 유추적용이 가능할 것으로 보인다.
다만 인공지능 로봇과 관련해서 차후에 적절한 입법이 필요하다는 점에는 이론이 없을 것이다. 인공지능 로봇에 의해 발생할 수 있는 손해의 배상책임 구도의 다원화와 합리적인 책임 배분이 필요해 보인다. 우선 기존의 논의에 따라 제조물책임이나 소유자의 책임으로 인정하기 위한 법리에 대한 검토가 선행되어야 할 것이다. 여기에 더해 인공지능 로봇에 의한 손해발생에 대해 배상할 수 있는 보험제도 등에 관한 연구도 병행되어야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

완샹그룹, 웨이차이, 쥔셩전자, 닝보화샹전자, 완펑아오터 등 5개 주요 부품회사의 해외 M&A 사례를 분석한 결과 완샹의 경우 해외 M&A 이후 중국에 합작회사를 설립하였고 배터리 관련 특허를 대량으로 출원하여 해외 기술 습득과 기술혁신의 성과를 보여주었다. 이에 비해 나머지 4개 회사는 피인수기업과의 공동 또는 독자적인 기술 개발의 증거를 찾지 못하였다. M&A를 통해 선진 기술을 도입하고 첨단 제품을 생산하게 되었을지는 모르지만 그 기술을 내부화시켰다고 볼 수는 없었다.
중국 정부의 부품산업 정책은 대형화를 통한 경쟁력 제고이다. 큰 기업이 양질의 기술을 개발할 수 있다는 논리인데, 중국 기업들의 특허를 분석해 보니 소수 기업에 특허가 너무 집중되어 있었다. 기술혁신의 성과가 극소수 기업에게만 집중된다면 전체 부품산업의 발전에는 부정적 영향을 줄 가능성이 크다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

External labor is mainly used in the form of in-house subcontracting where a client contractor (hereinafter “client”) facilitates workers of another prime contractor (hereinafter “contractor”) to work at the client’s workplace. The problem, however, is not in contracting out and making use of external labor. The problem is that even though businesses hire workers with rights protected by the Temporary Work Act or the Fixed-term Act, they disguise these workers as contract workers or entrusted workers to avoid being subject to related labor laws. Disguised subcontracting not only raises problems in the context of labor law, it also raises inequity issues. As disguised contracting is subject to criminal punishment under the Temporary Work Act, it is important to distinguish contract work and temporary work prior to punishing the user company.




Unfortunately, the current law does not clearly distinguish the difference between contract work and temporary work. To be sure, progress has been made regarding this issue. As a result, many cases were accumulated and composed together to establish legal principles that provide standards to differentiate contract work and temporary work. In addition, in 2015, the Supreme Court provided a general standard using various cases including the Hyundai Motor case. Despite the provision of the general standard, however, a more explicit standard to differentiate the two works is required for the following reasons: first, the general standard is a mere group of signs drawn from previous cases; second, the general standard does not fully reflect the distinctive features of each respective type of in-house subcontracting; and third, the process of making a comprehensive judgement after individual judgement is very unclear and as a result, despite the Supreme Court’s decision in 2015, judgements among lower courts have remained inconsistent.




Also, the Korean government has been making efforts to address the problem of disguised contracting on industrial sites by referring to the Guidelines on the Judging Standards of Temporary Placement of Workers (April 19, 2007) as outlined in the Reference to Classify Temporary and Contract Work. However, these guidelines do not reflect the general standard set out by the Supreme Court in 2015. This type of miscommunication can hinder the predictability of judgements distinguishing temporary and contract work, and eventually weaken the public’s trust in law. It can also raise doubts on the effect of measures taken to prevent further disguised contracting. Furthermore, it is important to note that the Supreme Court focused on the status of the worker when establishing the classifying standard. Thus, further discussion is necessary to determine the suitability of the standard when applying it to interpret criminal elements related to the violation of the Temporary Work Act.




Based on such research, this article concludes that the current Temporary Work Act should be at the center of establishing the classifying standard. This article also proposes a new standard to distinguish temporary and contract work focusing on the requirements of temporary work under the current Temporary Work Act, as well as the specific contents of the authority to conduct which was developed through the legal principle set out by the Supreme Court.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,새로운 유형의 음주측정불응행위에 대한 법리적 검토 = The legal study on new type of Refusing Field Sobriety Test(RFST),"음주운전,호흡측정,음주측정불응,도로교통법,경찰재량,drunken driving,breath testing,refusing field sobriety test,road traffic act,police discretion","현행 도로교통법에 따르면, 경찰공무원은 교통의 안전과 위험방지를 위하여 필요하다고 인정하거나 술에 취한 상태에서 자동차등을 운전하였다고 인정할 만한 상당한 이유가 있는 경우에는 운전자가 술에 취하였는지를 호흡조사로 측정할 수 있고, 운전자가 경찰공무원의 측정에 응하지 않으면 처벌한다.
  도로교통법을 제정할 당시에는 음주측정과 음주측정불응죄를 규정하지 않았다가 1980년 개정하면서 처음으로 규정하였다. 그러나 ‘교통안전과 위험방지의 필요성’이라는 요건으로 인하여 음주측정에 불응하더라도 처벌할 수 없는 문제점이 발생하여 1995년 ‘술에 취한 상태에서 운전하였다고 인정할만한 상당한 이유’라는 요건이 추가되었다. 음주측정불응죄는 주로 두 번째 요건에서 다툼이 있어왔고, 대법원 역시 이 요건을 충족하는지 여부로 판결하여 왔다.
  그러나 최근 들어 운전자가 음주단속현장에서 ‘도주’하는 유형의 음주측정불응행위가 나타났고, 이에 대해 대법원은 음주운전에 대한 혐의는 있으나 증명력이 부족하여 음주운전죄로 처벌할 수 없다고 판결하고 있다.
  본 연구에서는 음주측정불응죄에 대해 역사적·문리적·목적적 해석방법으로 검토하였다. 역사적 해석방법에 있어서는 도로교통법의 제정시부터 현재까지 관련 규정의 변화를 살펴보았고, 문리적 해석방법에서는 ‘교통안전과 위험방지의 필요성’ 및 ‘술에 취한 상태에서 운전하였다고 인정할만한 상당한 이유’에 대해 분석하였고, 목적적 해석방법에 대해서는 음주측정불응죄를 신설하고 그 처벌을 강화한 목적을 해석하였다. 이러한 해석방법을 바탕으로 새로운 유형의 음주측정불응행위가 음주측정불응죄에 해당하는지 검토한 결과, ‘운전석 창문 미개방행위’와 달리 ‘도주’행위는 음주측정불응죄에 해당한다는 결론이 도출되었다. 그러나 보다 더 바람직한 방안은 이에 대해 입법화하는 것일 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with their performance weakening in the past few years, Korea’s annual growth rate has dropped to less than 2%. Just as the Japanese economy struggled through the lost decades, Korea’s leading industries have been facing signals of arriving at a Strategic Inflection Point (“SIP”) since the mid-2000s. The objective of this study is to present an appropriate value strategy for Korean firms in leading industries to gain sustainable competitive advantages. This paper examines the following issues : First, it diagnoses the signs and timing of SIP for the five leading industries. Second, this study examines 78 Korean and Japanese firms in order to understand the adaptation strategies of the highest and lowest performing firms from a value strategy point of view. Third, it empirically analyzes the correlation between the indicators of value strategy and the accounting performances of the Korean and Japanese firms. The data set used in the cluster analysis were collected from KISLINE database of NICE Information Service and annual reports. The findings in the case analyses of high and low performing companies show that high value-added specialty chemical materials and electronic component manufacturers that had a strong focus on value creation were defined as high performing companies. And in the cosmetic and automobile industries, companies with a strong emphasis on value appropriation gained high performance. Furthermore, the study conducted a cluster analysis based on two indicators R&D and advertisement expense. The analysis shows that a significant gap exists in the operating incomes among three groups classified under the value strategy. The study recommends that Korean firms are requested to increase R&D expenditure, conduct M&A and collaborate with companies that own source technologies to narrow the technology gap and improve their segment portfolio from commodity to value-added products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,Strategy of Market Spread-Commercialization in EVs Industry : Visegrad and Nordic Countries,"Manufacturing, Commercialization, EVs, Visegrad, Nordic, Smart City, Blockchain","Purpose - The purpose of this study is to classify that the quality factors for comparing the Visegrard Group with the Nordic Council have historical similarities against Germany and the Soviet Union. However, this is because in the integrated European market, the competitiveness possessed by the two groups of countries is invested in the priority order to grow. 
Research design, data, and methodology ? The study was conducted on the research design, and the reason for trying to compare the competence of the automobile industry in the assessment of industrial capability is that the Visegrard Group focuses on automotive production and the Nordic Association focuses on the commercialization of the automobile(market). In this study, searching and quantifying indirect evidence was made through standards are more complementary in Europe since each country acts like the role of the European automotive industry for example, which is different from the realistic evaluation criteria, are more important than those of the United States(first in the world) or Germany(first in Europe). 
Results - The results of this study are as follows: In the global EV market U.S.(export: $ 2.62 billion /share: 36.7%), Germany($ 1.29 billion /18.1%), France($ 390 million /5.4%), United Kingdom($ 380 million /5.4%), and South Korea($ 320 million/ 4.4%). South Korea's share of the EV market is 4.4%, while TSI reaches at +0.9 which measures the comparative advantage of a specific commodity in the world trade market. There is great potential for evaluated as products processing in export competition. But, commercialization, standardization, and overall market expansion did not have a positive impact on global satisfaction. 
Conclusions - EVs put importance on various utilities. So this suggests that Korea's exports to the EU, including the Visegrard Group, should be more focused on marketability when illuminating with a sharing industrial system under the European Union. It is necessary to specialize in manufacturing and commercialization by country(region) to prepare sharing economy and blockchain in order to create a smart-sharing city linked on artificial intelligence, as the commercialization of electric vehicles, which will have a larger growth rate than that of manufacturing in the fourth revolutionary era.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

첫째, 상법 보험편에는 단체보험과 관련하여 단체생명보험에 관한 규정인 제735조의3 외에는 어떠한 규정도 없고, 보험업법 등에도 단체보험의 정의규정은 없는 상태에서 단체보험에 관한 다른 규정을 두고 있을 뿐이다. 단체보험의 높은 이용도, 그 법적 특수성 등에 비추어 단체보험에 관한 정의규정을 신설할 것을 제언한다.
둘째, 단체손해보험은 기본적으로 1개의 단일한 보험이지만, 단체구성원 중 일부에게 하자가 있는 경우의 선의의 단체구성원들을 보호할 수 있는 입법적 조치가 필요하므로 상법상 단체보험의 일부 해지에 관한 규정을 신설하거나 단체손해보험 약관에 개별담보조항을 두는 것을 제언한다.
셋째, 단체가 단체손해보험에서 실질적으로 수행하는 역할을 감안하여 경우에 따라서 단체에 보험자의 대리인으로서의 지위를 인정할 필요가 있다.
마지막, 단체손해보험의 실질적인 권리자는 단체구성원이다. 그럼에도 상법 등 각종 법률이나 보험약관에는 단체구성원의 권리를 인정할 수 있는 명시적인 규정이 없다. 상법에 “단체구성원이 보험료를 부담할 경우에 단체구성원이 보험계약자로서 권리를 행사할 수 있다.”는 규정을 신설할 필요가 있다. 이 경우에는 보험업법상 보험자의 설명의무의 상대방으로 단체보험의 단체구성원을 인정하도록 한다. 나아가서 단체손해보험의 약관에 단체손해보험계약의 가입 및 해지 과정에서 단체구성원이 갖는 여러 가지 권리를 명시적으로 규정하도록 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNC는 실질적인 효율성 향상을 통해서 소비자 혜택으로 연결될 수 있으며, 자기 주도적이고 유연한 근무를 추구하는 사람들을 포함하여 많은 근로자에게 매력적인 옵션이 될 수 있기 때문이다. 많은 도시에서 TNC 서비스에 대한 수요가 점점 증대되고 있다는 점이 이를 증명한다. 보다 근본적으로, 소극적인 정책으로는 4차 산업혁명이 가져올 더 큰 차원의 변화에 적절히 대응하기가 어려울 것이다. 보이지 않는 미래의 발전에 대응하기 위해서 유연한 규제체계를 정비하는 작업이 필요하다.
이와 관련하여 TNC의 연착륙을 위해서 기존의 운송관련 규제를 개선하는 방안을 제시하는 주장이 있다. 즉 택시 규정을 중심으로 기존의 규정을 손질하여 TNC 서비스를 포섭하는 규제를 만들자는 방안이다. 하지만 현 시점은 이미 소비자들이 TNC 플랫폼의 편리성을 인식하고 다양한 플랫폼의 이용이 증가하고 있는 상황이다. 따라서 잠재적으로 발생할 수 있는 부정적인 영향을 관리하면서 궁극적으로 소비자들에게 혜택이 돌아갈 수 있는 보다 적극적인 노력이 필요한 시점이다. 이러한 관점에서 캘리포니아를 중심으로 미국 다수의 주들이 제도적으로 도입한 별도의 TNC 관련 입법을 제안하는 바이다. 기존의 택시관련 규정을 개정하는 입법 수준이 아닌 새로운 기술을 포섭할 수 있는 혁신적인 입법을 통해서 카풀 중개를 포함한 다양한 TNC 플랫폼을 시장에 제도화하는 것이 바람직하다. 이러한 접근을 통해서 새로운 시장을 개척할 수도 있고, 무엇보다도 이를 이용하는 소비자들의 안전과 권익을 증진시킬 수 있을 것이다.
우선, 미국의 TNC 관련 규정을 철저히 검토하여 우리나라 시장에 적합한 TNC 관련 입법을 모색해야 하겠다. 이와 더불어 이미 TNC 서비스가 활발히 이용되고 있는 미국을 비롯한 다른 나라의 사례들을 분석하여 새로운 입법에 참고하는 것이 필요하다. 또한 규제당국은 공공의 이익을 위해서 TNC가 제공하는 데이터를 활용한 모니터링과 같은 보다 가볍고 유연한 규제방식도 고려할 수 있겠다. TNC와 운전자가 가능한 많은 정보를 규제 당국에 제공하도록 유도하는 방식은 실질적으로 공공의 이익을 담보할 수 있는 선순환으로 이어질 수 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  그러나 우리 대법원은 사법작용에 대한 국가배상과 관련하여 법관이 위법 또는 부당한 목적을 가지고 재판하는 등 법관이 그에게 부여된 권한의 취지에 명백하게 어긋나게 행사하였다고 인정할 만한 특별한 사정이 있는 경우에 한하여 인정할 수 있다고 판시함으로써 사실상 그 인정범위에 대하여 매우 제한적으로 해석하여 오고 있다.
  이러한 대법원의 판결은 사법작용에 대한 국가배상을 지나치게 제한하고 있는 것이다. 지난 우리의 역사에서 공정치 못한 재판으로 인하여 피해를 입은 피해자들이 존재하여 온 것이 사실이고, 이들에 대한 사법부의 반성과 사과가 미흡하였다는 점에 비추어 볼 때, 재판에 대한 국가배상의 책임을 확대할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,상생형 지역일자리 전망과 노사정의 사회적 연대책임,,"지난 8월 20일 합작법인 ‘광주글로벌모터스’가 공식적으로 출범하며 지난 5년간 추진되어오던 <광주형 일자리 사업>이 본격적으로 출발했습니다. 광주에 이어 구미, 군산, 대구 등 10여개 지자체가 앞다투어 유사한 사업을 추진하며 <상생형 지역일자리 모델>은 전국적으로 빠르게 확산 과정에 있습니다.

  그런데 광주글로벌모터스와 노동계는 현대자동차 추천이사 거취와 노동이사제 도입을 둘러싸고 견해차가 좀처럼 좁혀지지 않고 있는 상태로, 한국노총 광주본부는 지난 10월에 들어 ‘참여중단’을 선언한 상황입니다.

  과연 상생형 지역일자리 공모사업이 <노사관계 혁신>과 <생산적 국내투자>를 통해 <사회통합형 일자리>를 만들어내겠다는 본래 취지를 제대로 지켜낼 수 있을지는 현재로서는 미지수입니다. 자칫 정부의 예산지원으로 지역공단에 하나의 기업만 유치하는 데 그칠 수도 있기 때문입니다.

  이번 10월호 <노동N이슈>에서는 대통령직속 기획위원회의 이상호 전문위원의 <상생형지역일자리 전망과 노사정의 사회적 연대책임>에 대한 논의를 공유합니다. 필자는 광주형 일자리사업이 추진된 가장 큰 배경이 ‘노동시장 이중구조’와 ‘노사관계의 갈등적 담합’을 극복해 <사회통합형> 일자리 사업으로 ‘제조업 위기’를 돌파하는 데 있다고 설명합니다. 그런데 이 사업이 가진 상징성과 유의미성은 충분하지만, 노사관계와 생산체계를 혁신하려는 논의가 어느 새 임금수준과 공장설립에만 초점이 맞추어지며 아쉬움이 남는다고 설명합니다.

  이에 독일 폭스바겐의 거점지역의 노사정 다층적 파트너십 사례를 참고할 필요가 있다고 제시합니다. 폭스바겐은 사측과 노동조합이 사회연대적 입장에서 연대책임을 가지고 서로 양보를 통해 공장 이전 및 설립으로 일자리를 창출했습니다. 나아가 기술 이전, 공동연구, 공동 직훈과 같은 실질적 산업혁신활동을 주도하며 지역산업의 혁신적 발전을 꾀하고 있습니다. 아울러 그 과정에서 지역정부 역시 적극적으로 지역사회 구성원과 폭스바겐의 역할을 긍정적인 방향으로 유도하기 위한 주체적인 역할을 한다는 점에 주목할 필요가 있습니다.

  즉 이상호 전문위원은 <지역일자리 모델>의 본질은 대기업은 생산적 국내투자 활성화와 참여적 노사관계를 받아들이고, 노동조합은 적정일자리 모델과 청년채용을 위한 책임분담, 생산체계의 혁신을 합의하는 전략적 타협에 있다고 강조합니다.

  이하의 논의가 여러 지역에서 확산되고 있는 <상생형 지역일자리>사업에 참고가 되어 지역일자리 창출과 지역경제 활성화에 도움이 되기를 바래봅니다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,대기업집단 소속 공익법인의 현황과 개선과제,,"□ 경제개혁연구소(소장: 김우찬)는 공정거래위원회가 발표한 공익법인 실태조사 분석결과를 바탕으로, 대기업집단 소속 공익법인의 현황과 문제점을 확인하고 공정거래법은 물론 상속세및증여세법, 공익법인의 운영?설립에 관한 법률을 통해서 공익법인의 악용을 방지할 수 있는 방안을 찾아보았다.
  □ 우선 대기업집단의 공익법인이 보유한 자산의 규모는 전체 공익법인의 평균보다 6 배 높으며, 상위 대기업집단으로 갈수록 자산의 규모가 크게 늘어나 공익활동과 무관한 자산의 보유가 우려된다. 공익법인이 1 조원 이상의 자산을 보유한 대기업집단은 삼성, 현대중공업, 포스코, 한진, 두산, 현대자동차 6 개 대기업집단으로 이 자산 금액은 장부가 기준으로 작성된 대기업집단들도 있어 시가를 반영할 경우 더 크게 증가할 것으로 보인다. 자산의 구성을 보면 금융자산이 과반인 대기업집단이 가장 많았으나 주식이 과반인 대기업집단도 9 곳으로 나타나 주식의 시가를 반영하지 않았음에도 전체 공익법인에 비해 주식의 보유비율이 높은 것으로 나타났다.
  □ 손익측면에서 보면 대기업집단의 공익법인은 직접 공익목적사업을 위한 수입/지출이 전체 수입/지출에서 차지하는 비중이 전체 공익법인의 절반에 불과한 것으로 나타났다. 또한 계열회사 주식이 공익법인 자산에서 16.2%를 차지하지만 수입에서는 1.06%에 불과하였으며 계열회사 주식을 보유한 경우 66 개 중 35 개 공익법인만 배당을 받았고 배당수익률도 장부가 기준 2.6%로 나타났다. 특히 공익법인의 총자산대비 수익의 비율이 10%이하인 대기업집단들은 13 곳으로 수익률이 현저히 낮아 공익사업에 비해 필요이상의 자산을 보유한 것으로 추정해 볼 수 있는데, 이들 중 주식의 보유가 과반인 대기업집단이 30%에 해당했다.
  □ 이러한 수익률 계산은 장부가를 기준으로 한 것으로, 시가를 반영하여 다시 계산한 수익률은 더 하락하였다. 165 개 공익법인 중 주식을 보유하지 않은 공익법인 87 개, 계열회사 주식을 보유하지 않은 공익법인 13 개, 그리고 계열회사의 비상장주식만 보유한 16 개의 공익법인을 제외한 49 개의 공익법인의 장부가 기준 수익률은 3.62%이나 시가를 반영하여 재계산하면 1.9%로 절반 가까이 하락하였다. 특히 삼성전자, 삼성화재, 아모레퍼시픽 같은 계열회사 상장주식을 보유한 삼성문화재단이나 아모레퍼시픽재단의 경우 214.73%→0.41%, 39.99%→1.54%로 수익률이 급격히 하락했다.
  □ 이렇게 공익법인의 주식을 시가 평가할 경우 총자산에서 주식이 차지하는 비중은 21.8%에서 34%로 상승한다. 공익법인들의 계열회사 주식을 시가로 환산할 경우 장부가에 비해 평균 2.58 배가 증가하여 총 5 조원에 가까운 평가차익이 발생하며 일부 공익법인의 경우 2000 배 이상의 평가차익이 발생하기도 하였다.
  □ 대기업집단 소속 공익법인들은 낮은 수익률에도 불구하고 계열회사의 주식을 다수 보유하고 있으며, 자산에서 계열회사 주식이 차지하는 비율이 높고 매각할 경우 차익이 큼에도 불구하고 지속적으로 보유만 하고 있어 총수일가의 지배력 확대수단으로 공익법인이 악용되는 것은 아닌지 우려된다. 이에 따라 공정위에서는 특수관계인 합산 15%를 초과하는 공익법인의 주식에 대한 의결권 제한을 개정안으로 내 놓았으나 효과는 미미할 것으로 보인다. 의결권제한의 경우 다른 주주들의 분산 정도, 주총 참석률 등을 고려해야 정확한 효과를 확인할 수 있다. 특수관계인의 의결권(공익법인 미포함)이 30% 미만인 회사들의 경우 지분율이 상대적으로 낮은 편이라 의결권 제한에 영향이 있을 것으로 보이나 이에 해당하는 14 개 회사 중 공익법인이 1% 미만의 의결권을 보유한 회사가 9 개로 사실상 큰 영향은 없을 것으로 보인다.
  □ 공익법인은 공정거래법 만으로 규율할 수 없기 때문에 상증세법의 개정을 고려해야 한다. 특히 현재 운용소득 중 직접 공익목적사업에 활용하는 비율만 규제하고 있는데 수익률 자체를 규제하여 지배력확대를 위한 주식보유를 억제 하거나 의무지출제도를 도입하여 수익률이 저조한 자산의 매각을 유도할 필요가 있다. 또한 공익법인의 주식 평가와 관련한 기준을 시가기준으로 통일하여 총자산 중 일정비율 이상의 계열회사 주식보유를 금지한 현재 법규정이 실질적으로 그 목적을 달성할 수 있도록 해야 한다.
  □ 마지막으로 공익법인의 설립·운영에 관한 법률의 공익성을 생각하여, 공익법인 법의 개정을 통해 일반적인 문제점들을 개선하는 것도 고려할 필요가 있다. 상증법에서 정의된 내용을 정리하여 계열공익법인을 정의하고, 모든 공익법인이 계열법인을 지배하는 것을 금지하거나, 영리법인을 지배할 목적으로 지분을 보유하는 것을 금지하는 방안과, 대기업집단의 경우만 계열공익법인의 지분보유를 금지하는 방안을 고려해 볼 수 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  따라서 전자계약을 체계적으로 정리하고 이를 민법전에 규정하거나, 아니면 적어도 단일 법률로 재정비하는 노력이 필요하다 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

연구방법: 2011년 전국 종합병원급 이상 권역응급료센터의 응급실 이용 현황 자료를 사용하였다. Dutton(1986)의 의료이용 모형을 활용하여 응급실 다방문에 영향을 미치는 요인을 분석하였으며 이를 위해 일반화추정방정식(GEE) 방법을 사용하였다.
연구결과: 2011년 총 605,604명의 환자가 733,184번 권역응급의료센터 응급실을 이용하였다. 응급실 다방문 결정요인을 분석한 결과, 남자가 여자보다 응급실 이용횟수가 높았고, 30대, 50대, 40대, 9세 이하, 10대 순으로 응급실 이용횟수가 높았다. 사고 보다 질병으로 내원한 환자가 응급실 이용횟수가 더 높았다. 암이나 정신질환을 보유한 환자가 그렇지 않은 환자보다 응급실 이용횟수가 더 높았다. 의료급여 환자, 자동차보험 환자, 건강보험 환자, 일반 환자 순으로 응급실 이용횟수가 높았다. 응급실 직접 방문 환자, 외래 경유 환자, 타 병원으로부터 전원 온 환자 순으로 응급실 이용횟수가 높았다. 개인 차량, 119서비스, 사설 앰뷸런스, 도보 순으로 응급실 이용횟수가 높았다. 응급실 체류시간이 60분 미만인 경우 응급실 이용횟수가 높았다. 응급실 방문일이 화-금요일, 월요일, 토요일, 일요일 순으로 응급실 이용횟수가 높았다. 퇴실 후 귀가 환자, 입원 환자, 타 병원으로 전원 된 환자 순으로 응급실 이용횟수가 높았다. 트리아지가 9점(중증)인 환자보다 9점미만(경증)인 환자의 응급실 이용횟수가 더 높았다.
결론: 본 연구결과 권역응급의료센터 다이용 환자를 감소시키기 위해서는 권역응급의료센터를 우회하여 이용할 수 있는 의료기관들에 대한 정보를 지역 주민들에게 제공함으로써 주민들 스스로가 권역응급의료센터를 이용하지 않도록 하여야 할 것이다. 또한 비응급환자의 의료이용을 병원이용 전단계에서부터 원할히 조정해주고, 1차 의료제공체계를 구축하여 지역사회 중심의 완화의료를 포함한 통합의료서비스를 제공해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,업무용 승용차에 대한 세법상 제한규정의 시행이 개인사업자의 자동차 보유에 미친 영향의 분석 = Effects of Tax Laws Regulations on Business Purpose Car on Acquisition Behaviors of Sole Proprietors,"개인사업자,업무용 자동차,세법상 규제,절세효과,조세회피,Sole proprietor,Business purpose car,Tax laws regulations,Tax aaving effect,Tax avoidance","2016년에 시행된 업무용 자동차에 대한 세법상 제한규정으로 인해 고가의 승용차를 사용하는 개인사업자의 경우에는 필요경비 산입액의 제한에 따른 세금부담의 증가로 인해 낮은 가격대의 승용차로 차종을 변경했을 유인이 있었을 것으로 예상할 수 있다. 이에 반해 세금부담의 증가에도 불구하고 고가의 승용차를 운행하는 것이 사업상의 과시효과를 위해 필요하거나 엄격한 세법상 제한규정의 시행에 허점이 많아서 실효성이 충분하지 않기 때문에 개인사업자들이 동(同)제한규정을 중요하게 취급하지 않는 경우에는 차종 변경이 종전과 비슷한 수준에서 이루어졌을 반대의 가능성도 있다.
본 연구는 2016년을 대상으로 한 재정패널조사 10차년도 자료를 이용해서 이러한 업무용 승용차에 대한 세법상 제한규정의 시행으로 인해 개인사업자의 차량보유 행태가 과거와 비교해서 변동했는지의 여부를 확인하였다.
실증분석의 결과 한계효과의 분석 및 기간별 비교에서 공통적으로 차량의 취득·유지와 관련한 필요경비 산입으로 인한 개인사업자 가구의 기본적인 절세효과는 충분히 발생하는 반면 2016년에 시행된 업무용 승용차에 대한 세법상 규제가 절세효과의 감소로 인해 개인사업자 가구의 차량 취득에 미친 부정적 영향을 별도로 확인할 수 없었고, 그 결과 2016년 이후에도 전체적인 절세효과가 충분히 유지되는 것으로 나타났다.
2016년에 시행된 업무용 차량에 대한 세법상 규제의 비유의적 영향은 2016년의 경우에는 동(同)규제가 전체 개인사업자 대신 복식부기의무자 중 성실신고확인대상사업자만을 대상으로 시행되었기 때문에 대다수의 개인사업자에 대해서는 심리적 부담 외의 실질적인 세금부담이 발생하지 않은 것과 함께 전체 필요경비의 영구적 부인 대신 연간 800만원의 한도액을 초과하는 금액의 귀속시기를 장래로 이연하는 제한적인 과세상 불이익의 성격이 영향을 미친 것으로 해석할 수 있다. 또한, 다른 측면에서는 세금부담의 증가에도 불구하고 고가의 승용차를 운행하는 것이 사업상 과시효과를 위해 필요하기 때문에 이러한 비조세적 유인이 세금부담에 비해 훨씬 중요했을 가능성도 고려할 수 있다. 이와 함께 세법상 규제의 불완전성으로 인해 개인사업자가 상대적으로 사업이 부진해서 수입금액이 낮은 연도에 차량을 처분하면서 발생한 거액의 장부상 손실을 세법상 규제와 무관하게 그 다음 연도까지 전액 필요경비에 산입할 수 있는 것 등과 같이 조세회피에 활용될 수 있는 가능성으로 인해 비유의적 결과가 나타났을 가능성도 있다.
당초의 정책취지에 부합하지 않는 이러한 세법상 규제의 비유의적 시행 결과는 2017년부터 전체 복식부기의무자로 그 대상이 확대됨으로써 다소 완화될 수 있지만, 개인사업자들의 의식 개선과 함께 가능한 조세회피에 대한 대응이 이루어지지 않을 경우에는 개선되기 어려울 것으로 예상할 수 있다. 따라서, 과세당국은 개인사업자들의 자동차 보유·운행 및 전반적인 필요경비 계상과 관련한 보다 면밀한 검토를 통해 당초의 정책취지에 부합할 수 있는 실효성 있는 조세제도의 개편방안을 마련할 필요성이 있을 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1998년과 2009년 경제 위기를 경험하면서 기업과 산업 네트워크에서는 경제 충격과 회복에 관한 연구가 주요한 연구 주제로 등장하였다. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리나라 지역을 대상으로 경제 충격 이후의 회복(리질리언스)를 실증적 분석한 연구는 시작단계이다.
이에 본 연구에서는 경제 충격과 회복의 시점에서 발견되는 지역 산업생태계의 공진화 과정을 분석하고자 한다. 경제 충격에 따른 기업 네트워크의 동태적 변화 과정은 어떻게 진행하는가? 기업 네트워크의 공진화 과정에서 발견되는 네트워크 구조적 특징은 지역별로 어떤 차이가 존재하는가? 등의 연구 질문을 통해 변화하는 지역경제와 이에 따른 산업생태계의 네트워크 특성을 분석하는 것이 본 연구의 목적이다. 분석을 위하여 국가 경제 위기가 존재했던 1998년과 2009년 그리고 2019년을 기점으로 한국 자동차부품 관련 기업 네트워크의 동태적 변화 과정을 분석하였다.
분석 결과 국가 경제 위기 이후 자동차 기업 네트워크의 주요 허브인 대우자동차, 아시아, 대림자동차 등이 소멸되면서 네트워크의 전체 크기는 감소하였으며 주요 허브의 감소로 소수 허브로의 집중하는 현상을 보였다. 반면에 평균연결정도 값은 증가하였고 이는 복수 거래망을 가진 기업이 증가함을 의미하는 것이다. 지역별 분석결과 강원권, 충청권은 네트워크 크기가 증가하는 현상을 보였다. 기업의 입지가 증가하고 타 기업과의 거래 연결성이 높아짐으로서 해당 지역의 네트워크가 성장하는 것으로 분석할 수 있었다. 네트워크의 평균연결정도가 전국보다 높은 지역은 수도권, 충청권, 대경권으로 분석되어 복수 거래망을 지닌 기업이 다수 입지하는 현상을 반영하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,"환율변동이 산업별 수출에 미치는 영향과 시사점 - 원화 강세 지속 시 기계, IT, 자동차 산업 수출이 가장 큰 타격",,"■ 원화 강세 지속
주요국 통화 대비 원화의 절상률이 큰 폭으로 상승하고 있다. 달러 대비 원화는 2018년 1월 평균 1,067원 수준으로 10.0%(전년동월대비) 절상되었다. 2017년 12월 절상률(전년동월대비)이 8.2%인 것을 고려하면 2018년 들어 절상폭이 약 1.8%p 확대되었다. 더욱이 2017년 4분기 수출의 성장기여도는 -2.3%p(실질, 계절조정)로 급격히 하락한 가운데 수출액 증가율도 크게 둔화되는 흐름이다. 장기적 원화 강세는 수출 경기에 부정적인 영향을 미칠 가능성이 크다. 본고에서는 원화 강세 흐름에 따른 최근 수출의 특징을 살펴보고, 원/달러 환율 하락이 산업별 수출에 미치는 영향을 분석하고자 한다.
■ 최근 국내 수출의 특징
(세계 경기의 회복 지속에도 한국 수출 성장세 둔화) 세계 경기의 회복세가 지속되고 있지만 한국의 수출 증가세는 오히려 둔화되고 있다. OECD 경기선행지수가 2016년 4월 99.5p를 저점으로 2017년 11월 100.2p까지 상승세를 이어가는 등 세계 경기 회복세가 지속되고 있다. 반면에, 2017년 3분기 21.5%까지 상승했던 국내 수출 증가율은 4분기 들어 8.1%로 급락했다. 이와 함께 한국의 경기선행지수도 2017년 11월 99.9p로 기준점 100p를 하회한 것으로 나타나, 경기 둔화 우려가 커지고 있다. (원화 강세 흐름 속 수출 단가 상승세 둔화 및 물량 감소) 2017년 3분기 이후 원/달러 환율이 하락세로 전환되면서 수출 단가 상승세도 둔화되고 있을 뿐 아니라 수출 물량도 감소세로 전환되면서 수출 환경이 악화되고 있다. 수출 단가 증가율은 2017년 2분기 15.7%를 고점으로 3분기 14.3%, 4분기 8.9%로 둔화되었으며, 수출물량 증가율 역시 3분기 7.2%에서 4분기 -0.8%로 감소세로 전환되었다. 원/달러 환율은 2017년 3분기까지 전년 동기에 비해 가치 절하 추세를 보였으나, 4분기 들어 4.5%의 가치 절상이 이루어졌다.
■ 원/달러 환율변화가 산업별 수출에 미치는 영향
원/달러 환율이 1% 하락(가치 절상)할 경우 총수출은 0.51% 감소하는 것으로 추정된다. 산업별로는 원/달러 환율 1% 하락 시 기계 0.76%, IT 0.57%, 자동차 0.4%, 석유화학 0.37%, 철강 0.35%, 선박 0.18% 순으로 수출 감소 효과가 큰 것으로 추정된다. 특히, 세계 수출 시장에서 일본, 독일 등과의 경쟁이 치열한 기계, 자동차 산업(2015년 현시비교우위지수 기계 : 한국(0.99), 일본(1.58), 자동차 한국(1.60), 일본(2.61))은 물론 국내 수출 비중이 가장 높은 IT 산업은 원화 강세가 장기적으로 지속될 경우 피해가 더 커질 가능성도 상존한다.
■ 시사점
최근 원화 강세가 지속되는 상황에서 수출 불안이 내수 경기 악화로 전이될 가능성을 차단하기 위한 정책적 대응이 필요하다. 첫째, 외환시장 안전성 유지를 위한 일관성 있는 정책 추진이 필요하다. 중장기적으로 투명하고 일관성 있는 금융통화정책수립을 통해 신뢰성 확보를 위한 소통(Announcement) 강화 노력이 병행 되어야 할 것이다. 둘째, 원화 강세와 보호무역주의 강화에 따른 주력 수출 산업의 피해를 최소화하기 위한 대응책 마련이 절실하다. 세이프가드, 한미 FTA 개정 협상 등 미국의 보호무역주의 강화에 효율적으로 대응하기 위해서는 민관 협의체 구성 등을 통해 정부와 기업의 공동대응 노력이 필요할 것이다. 셋째, 원화 강세에 대비하여 수출제품 및 시장 다변화 등 수출 구조 고도화를 위한 적극적 노력이 필요하다. 글로벌 밸류 체인(Value Chain)강화, FTA 활용 제고, 신시장 개척 등을 통해 수출 구조 고도화를 위한 노력을 기울여야 할 것이다. 넷째, 급격한 원화 절상에 따른 피해기업 지원과 중소, 중견기업 환리스크 지원 제도를 강화해야 할 필요가 있다. 수출 중소, 중견기업들의 환율변동 리스크 대응력 강화를 위해 전문 인력 지원 등 정책적 제도마련이 필요하다. 다섯째, 기업은 원화 강세에 대비하여 체질 개선과 경쟁력 강화를 위한 중장기적인 전략 마련이 필요하다. 제품의 고부가가치화, 생산성 혁신 뿐 아니라 브랜드 가치 제고, 기술력향상 등 경쟁력 강화를 위한 노력을 지속해야 할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KIST의 철강공업에 대한 가장 중요 한 기여로는 1969년에 있었던 신사업계획의 수립을 들 수 있다. 신사업계획은 종합제철사업 계획 연구위원회가 마련했으며, KIST의 김재관과 윤여경이 이를 주도했다. 신사업계획은 규 모의 경제, 설비의 구성, 제철소의 확장가능성 등의 측면에서 우수한 내용을 담고 있었다. 신 사업계획을 바탕으로 한국은 일본과의 협상을 추진하여 포항제철소 건설사업을 현실화할 수 있었다. 포항제철의 공식 기록은 오랫동안 신사업계획을 KIST가 주도했다는 점에 대해 언급 하지 않다가 최근에 들어서야 이를 수용하는 모습을 보였다. 이로써 KIST의 연구진이 신사업계획을 주도했다는 점은 KIST의 주장에 머물지 않고 포항제철도 인정하는 사실이 되었다. 신사업계획의 수립 이외에도 KIST는 일본과의 실무협상 추진, 제철소 운영에 대비한 예비조사, 일본 기술자를 활용한 기술자문 등을 통해 포항제철소 건설사업을 적극 지원했다. 이처 럼 KIST의 한국 철강공업에 대한 기여는 계획수립, 실무협상, 기술지원 등을 망라하는 총체적인 성격을 띠고 있었다. 이에 반해 기계공업, 조선공업, 자동차공업 등과 같은 다른 중공업 분야의 경우에는 KIST의 역할이 주로 계획수립의 차원에 머물렀던 것으로 판단된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

O2O서비스는 소비자의 생활과 밀접한 서비스이므로 개인정보보안에 대한 이슈와 소비자와 플랫폼 업체 간의 발생되는 중개플랫폼의 신뢰성에 대한 소비자의 반응, 마지막으로 O2O서비스에 대해 인지하는 개인과 집단 간의 차이를 살펴보기 위한 사회적 규범을 주요 요인으로 살펴보았다. 301명을 대상으로 자료를 수집하였으며 연구문제를 검증하기 위해 분산분석을 실행하였다. 연구결과 O2O서비스 중 배달 서비스가 카셰어링 서비스보다 상대적으로 개인정보보안, 중개플랫폼의 신뢰, 사회적 규범이 낮은 소비자 집단에서 서비스태도에 더 호의적이었다. 다만 사회적 규범의 경우, 사회적 규범이 높은 소비자 집단에서 카셰어링 서비스가 더 호의적인 태도를 보였는데, 이러한 결과는 제공되는 서비스제품 유형(식품관련 서비스 vs. 자동차관련 서비스)이 다름에서 나타나는 현상으로 해석된다. 이와 같은 결과를 토대로 시사점과 향후 연구방향을 제시하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

거부처분에 대한 취소소송을 적법하게 제기하려면, 관할행정청의 거부행위가 취소소송의 대상이 되는 거부처분으로 되어야 하는바, 거부처분이 되기 위해서는 신청인에게 신청권이 있어야 한다는 것이 판례의 입장이다. 신청권의 존부와 관련하여 논의되는 것이 바로 행정개입청구권의 인정 여부이다. 독일 연방행정법원의 결정에서는 행동계획을 수립하여 달라는 청구와 관련하여서는 행동계획에 대하여 규율하고 있는 이미씨온보호법령의 사익보호성이 부정되었다. 그렇지만 계획과 무관 내지 독립된 비계획적 조치 ­ 예를 들면 디젤차량 운행제한, 화물자동차 도심통행금지, 배출시설의 가동제한 등 ­ 에 대해서는 연방이미씨온보호법령으로부터 사익보호성을 도출함으로 인하여 주관적 공권의 성립을 긍정하였다. 그리고 유럽최고법원의 판결에서는 유럽연합의 대기질지침의 사익보호성을 긍정하였으며, 나아가 깨끗한 공기에 대한 권리를 긍정하기에 이르렀고, 이러한 권리의 집행력을 확보하기 위하여 다양한 노력을 경주하고 있다. 우리나라에서도 미세먼지의 농도가 심한 경우에 법령에 규정되어 있는 감축조치들을 관할행정청이 취하지 아니하는 경우에 ­ 예를 들면 미세먼지법 제18조 상의 고농도 미세먼지 비상저감조치와 관련하여 ­ 그러한 법령상의 조치를 취하도록 소구할 수 있는가가 문제될 수 있을 것이다. 아직까지는 우리 법원은 이러한 법령에 근거하여 법원에 소송을 제기하는 경우에 원고적격과 본안심리에서 긍정적으로 바라보지는 않을 것으로 사료 ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PnC는 전기차 사용자 인증, 충전, 요금 청구 등의 모든 과정이 자동으로 처리되는 자동인증 기술을 말한다.
표준에 따르면 충전기와 CPS(Certificate Provisioning Service)의 인증서는 V2G(Vehicle to Grid) Root 인증서의 아래에 있어야 한다. 한국의 경우 한국전력공사가 자체적으로 PKI(Public Key Infrastructure)를 운영하고 있으므로 한전이 제공하는 충전기는 V2G Root 인증서의 아래에 있는 것이 어렵다. 따라서 서로 다른 Root 인증서를 가지고 있을 때에도 인증이 가능한 방법이 필요하다. 본 논문에서는 이를 위해 PnC 방식의 인증에 교차 인증서의 적용을 제안한다. 교차 인증서 자동인증은 서로 다른 Root 인증서를 가지더라도 인증이 가능하도록 Root CA의 교차 인증서를 발급하고 인증서 체인에 포함시켜 자동인증을 진행하는 것이다. 교차인증서 기술을 적용하면 다른 Root 인증서의 아래에 있는 인증서의 검증을 가능하도록 해준다. 본 논문에서는 PnC 방식과 교차 인증서를 적용한 PnC 방식의 자동인증을 구현하여, 두가지 방식이 모두 사용 가능함을 증명하는 개념 증명을 진행한다. 개발 요구사항과 인증서 프로파일, 사용자 인증 시퀀스를 작성하고, 이에 따라 구현, 실행한다. 이 실험을 통해 두 가지의 자동인증이 실행 가능하고, 특히 교차 인증서를 적용한 PnC 방식의 자동인증의 확장성이 뛰어남을 확인한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

미국제도의 배경에 대하여 소위 대립적 법률주의, 법경제학적인 관점, 제도주의적 관점에서 설명하는 견해들이 있다. 미국제도는 크게 보면 행정청이나 정부가 직접 소송을 제기한 후 미래의 행위에 대한 제약을 합의조항에 넣어서 종결하는 형태가 있는가 하면, 입법자의 인센티브를 통하여 私人이 소송을 제기하는 법집행 유형의 소송형태도 있다. 전자가 담배소송과 같은 전형적인 소송유형이라면 후자는 민권법으로 대표되면서 미국법 전반에 걸쳐 확대되고 있다.
미국의 소송을 통한 규제에 대하여는 절차적 보장을 회피하고 소비자에게 비용을 전가하며 변호사의 소송남용이라는 문제점이 제기되는 실정이다. 이 연구는 미국법의 제도를 소개하면서 우리나라에의 도입가능성과 그에 따른 비판적 평가의 관점을 제시하고, 추가적인 연구에 앞서 개략적인 제도설계의 방향을 제시하고자 하였다는 점에서 의의를 찾을 수 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,사물인터넷 활성화를 위한 입법과제 및 개선방안 연구 = Regulations and Government Legislatio ns Issues for Internet of Things,"사물인터넷, IT산업, 규제개선, 개인정보, 4차 산업혁명, IoT, IT Industry, Regulatory Reform, Personal Information, 4th Industrial Revolution","사물인터넷은 각종 사물에 센서와 통신기능을 내장하여 사람과 사물 그리고 공간을 인터넷으로 연결하고 이에 대한 정보를 수집·생성하는 것으로 최근 ICT 분야의 핵심 기술가운데 하나이다. 현재도 사물인터넷은 우리 삶 속에서 구현중인 기술이나 향후 4차 산업혁명의 주요한 기반기술이 되기 때문에 더욱 중요한 가치를 가진다.
이처럼 사물인터넷의 중요성에도 불구하고 아직 우리나라는 사물인터넷에 광범위한 직·간접의 규제가 이루어지고 있으며 이에 대한 개선이 필요하다. 문재인정부는 4차 산업혁명의 중요성을 인식하고 지난 19대 대통령 선거공약과 국정기획자문위원회를 통하여 신성장산업 육성을 위한 제도개선과 정비방안을 제시하였다. 그리고 신성장산업의 핵심으로 IT신산업을 육성하기 위하여 대통령직속으로 ′4차 산업혁명위원회′를 설치하고 법·제도·정책 혁신을 추진하고 있다. 그러한 측면에서 향후 사물인터넷과 관련된 규제개선과 법령정비 방안을 검토해 본다.
먼저 사물인터넷은 광범위한 개인정보규율을 받고 있다. 수범자 입장에서는 사물인터넷 사업을 영위하기 위하여 여러 법령을 종합적으로 검토하여야 하는데 법령해석에 어려움을 겪을 수밖에 없다. 따라서 산발적으로 흩어져 있는 개인정보보호법령들을 통일시켜야 하고 식별·결합가능성 등의 개념을 명확하게 하여야 한다.
또한 향후 공공사물인터넷은 민간 사물인터넷과 결합하여 폭발적인 시너지 효과를 창출할 것으로 보인다. 현재 공공사물인터넷을 포함한 공공영역에서 수집한 데이터 활용에 관하여 「공공데이터의 제공 및 이용활성화에 관한 법률」이 존재하고 이를 기초로 민간에 관련 정보를 제공하고 있다. 하지만 민간이 보유한 정보를 국가 또는 공공기관이 활용할 수 있는 법적 근거가 없기 때문에 이를 마련하여야 한다.
한편, 사물인터넷의 주요 활용사업은 자율주행자동차인데 「위치정보보호법」위반이 문제된다. 이 경우 개인 식별성이 없는 단순사물위치정보를 수집하여 가공하는 사물인터넷을 활용하는 경우 사전 동의 방식이 아닌 사후거절 방식을 취하도록 하는 등 관련 법률을 개정할 필요가 있다.
의료분야의 경우 사물인터넷의 발달에 따라 헬스케어 기기의 활용이 확대될 수 있는데 「의료기기법」의 규율대상이 되어 제조업 허가 및 판매업 신고 등 다양한 규제와 절차를 거치게 되는 문제가 있으므로 이에 관한 조정이 요구된다. 또한 보건의료 데이터에는 일반 개인정보보다 민감한 개인정보가 포함되어 있기 때문에 「개인정보보호법」상의 비식별 조치를 취하더라도 개별 법적근거를 마련하여 공공기관이 활용할 수 있도록 하여야 한다.
마지막으로 사물인터넷을 활용한 위치정보사업자의 경우 현재 인허가 규정이 강화되어 있기 때문에 이를 간소화할 필요가 있다. 현행 「위치정보보호법」은 위치정보사업을 하기 위해서는 방송통신위원회의 허가를 받도록 하고 있다. 반면, 사물인터넷을 활용하는 전기통신사업자의 경우 허가, 등록, 신고 등 다양한 진입 규제방식을 두고 있어 위치정보사업자와 비교했을 때 과도한 규제가 될 수 있다.

자동화 단계에 관한 SAE Level의 의미와 단계별 기술수준의 법적인 영향에 대해 검토한 후 현재로서는 당장 실현가능한 3단계 기술수준으로 인한 책임법과 책임보험법의 고찰이 필요하다고 결론을 내린 후에 3단계 자동화기술을 장착한 우버의 시험용 자율주행차량이 야기한 사고에 대해 고찰하였다. SAE 3단계 기술수준은 비상상황의 발생시 운전자의 개입을 전제하는 기술수준이다. 따라서, 3단계 자율주행차의 운전자는 자율주생시스템이 제어권회복의 경고를 발하는 경우 제어권을 회복하여야 하고 이에 대한 준비를 하고 있어야 한다.
우버의 사고와 관련해, 차량의 급격한 움직임을 회피하기 위해 우버가 볼보의 비상제통장치를 제거한 사실, 우버의 테스트드라이버가 보행자를 충격하기 직전 전방을 주시한 것이 아니라 iPad를 보고 있었다는 사실 등에 기반하여 우버의 시스템 제조자로서의 제조물책임, 우버의 운행자로서의 책임, 보행자의 주의의무와 책임 등에 대해 살펴보았다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

한편, 2019.6.13. 대법원은 통지의무위반과 약관설명의무와의 관계에서 보험자의 약관설명의무보다 보험계약자의 통지의무위반을 적용?판시하였다. 보험금청구권자 들은 전부면책의 원칙에 따라 보험금을 전혀 받지 못했다. 제1심판결은 ‘전동휠’이 이륜자동차에 포함된다는 사실이 고지의무나 통지의무의 대상이 됨에 관하여 설명의무위반이 있었음으로 통지의무위반을 적용할 수 없다고 판시하였으나 제2심과 대법원은 보험자 측은 약관설명의무를 충분히 이행하였다고 보고 제1심판결이 부당하다며 통지의무위반을 인정하였다. 이 판결이 잘 못 되었다고는 할 수 없지만 그 동안 계약을 잘 유지해 온 보험계약자 측과의 형평성?최대선의성 측면에서 해결할 수 있는 방안을 찾는 것이  필요하다고 생각했다. 이를 위해 보험소비자 입장에서 비교법적으로 고지의무제도를 살펴보았다. 특히, 수동화와 중과실비례감액제도에 관해 고찰하였다. 현재 우리의 생명보험약관에 직업 또는 직무 변경의 통지의무위반시 해지가 보험사고 발생 후에 이루어진 경우 보험요율의 비율에 따라 감액지급을 규정하고 있다. 이를 확대하여 모든 중과실에 의한 고지의무 또는 통지의무의 위반이나 보험사고시 과실의 정도에 따라 비례감액을 할 수 있는 비례보상제도의 도입과 수동화가 이 보험금 전무의 문제를 해결하는 한 방안임을 제시하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1965년의 해고수당법은 해고수당을 둘러싼 교섭이 확산되는 계기가 되었다. 노동조합이 조직되어 있는 공공부문과 대기업에서는 법정해고수당과 별도로 추가해고수당의 지급이 관행화되었다. 추가해고수당의 지급과 함께 감원의 주요 수단으로 희망퇴직 관행이 늘어났고, 이를 통해서 감원대상자 선발기준으로서 선임권원리(LIFO)의 비중은 후퇴했다. 희망퇴직 관행과 추가해고수당의 지급은 고용조정의기업분절적 특징을 강화시켰다. 희망퇴직이 종종 조기은퇴와 결합되어 진행되었는데, 이는 기업단위의 직업연금이 확대되었기 때문에 가능했다. 고용조정 및 해고보상이 기업분절적으로 불균등하게 이루어짐에 따라서 1980년대 실업보험의 심각한축소에 관해서 정책 당국에 대한 저항도 거의 일어날 수 없었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

하지만 밀레니얼 세대와 모바일이나 컴퓨터 등의 결합으로 전통적인 대면채널은 기간이 갈수록 그 영향력을 줄어들고, CM채널이나 TM채널 및 홈 쇼핑 등의 비대면채널이 시장의 점유비율을 점점 확장해 나갈 것으로 예상된다. 이러한 비대면채널은 독자적인 형태보다는 CM 채널의 경우 전화를 통한 상담 기능이 부가하는 방식을 이용한다거나 TM 채널의 경우 컴퓨터 화면을 보완하는 등을 통한 하이브리드 방식의 비대면 운용형태가 대세를 이룰 것으로 예상된다.
4차 산업혁명을 비롯한 기술의 발달로 인해 인공지능 설계사와 같은 채널이 등장할 경우 그동안 약점으로 지적되어 온 양방향 소통의 어려움 등 비대면채널의 단점이 극복될 것이다. 이러한 비대면채널의 출현과 발전은 소비자가 본인에게 알맞은 보험을 쉽게 찾아 가입할 수 있는 환경을 조성해 줄 것이고, 사회 후생이 증대되는 경제적 효과를 야기하게 될 것이며, 앞으로 보험시장에서는 새로운 기술력을 갖춘 또 다른 채널들이 다양하게 등장할 것으로 예상된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,"현대차그룹 지배구조 개편안에 대한 논평 -주주의 비례적 이익 관점에서- = Analysis on the Restructuring Plan of Hundai Motor Car Group dated on March 28, 2018","merger,fiduciary duty,duty of care,duty of loyalty,conflict of interests,Hyundai Mobis,Hyundai Glovis,선관의무,신인의무,충실의무,이해상충,현대모비스,현대글로비스,분할합병,합병","2018.3.28. 발표된 현대자동차 그룹의 지배구조 개편 방안의 주요 골자는 현대모비스와 현대글로비스 간의 분할합병과 지배주주에 의한 주식양수도이다. 이는 그룹의 이익으로 표현되는 지배주주의 이익과 일반주주의 이익 간의 충돌가능성, 그리고 그것을 여하히 조화할 것이냐는 결코 간단치 않은 문제가 내재되어 있다.
우선 주주의-비례적-이익 관점에서 볼 때 당해 방안의 첫 번째 문제점은 분할합병 시 합병가액 산정에 본질가치법을 적용토록 한 부분이다. 이는 절차적 공정성에 의문을 가지게 하며 분할회사가 저평가되는 상황을 야기하였다. 이를 극복하는 방법으로는, 현금흐름할인법의 엄격하고 투명한 적용 및/또는 분할-후-합병이라는 투스텝 거래로 구조를 설정함으로써 시장의 평가를 충분히 받도록 한 뒤 합병을 하는 방법 등을 상정해 볼 수 있다. 이러한 방법도 여의치 않을 경우 궁극적으로는 주주 간 이해상충에 상법 398조와 특별이해관계인 의결권 제한 조항을 적극적으로 적용하는 것이 필요하다. 두 번째로 주주의-비례적-이익 관점에서 주목할 것은 분할합병 후의 계열사와 지배주주 간의 주식양수도 거래이다. 이것은 지배주주에 대한 ‘몰아주기’에 의한 지배권 집중과 부의 이전 위험성이 내재되어 있으므로 그 가치평가에 위와 같은 특성이 충분히 반영되도록 해야 공정한 거래가 될 수 있다. 한편, 거래의 목적이 경영권 승계인지, 또는 회사와 주주에겐 이익이 없이 지배주주의 사익추구를 위한 거래인지 등과 같은 거래 목적을 둘러싼 논쟁은 회사법적 관점에서는 그 의미가 대폭 축소되어야 하며 논의 순서도 뒤로 돌려 손해 문제부터 확정한 이후에나 고려해야 한다.
한편 이러한 지배주주-일반주주 간 이해상충 문제에 대하여 현재 한국의 회사법적 대응은 불충분하다. 즉 회사법 해석상 통설적 지위를 차지하며 확고한 판례로 정립되어 있는 법인이익-계좌기준은, 위의 주주의 비례적 이익 관점과 달리, 법인과 주주 이익을 분리한 뒤 전자만 보호하며, 일반주주의 이익과 주주전체의 비례적 이익보호에 소홀하여 균형을 확보하기 어렵다. 이를 극복하는 방안으로 주주의 이익과 법인의 이익이 다르다는 점을 인정하고 주주의 이익을 보호하는 방안의 강구가 필요하다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,토지의 효율적 이용을 위한 분묘관리 개선방안 연구- 장묘제도의 비교법적 연구를 중심으로 - = A Study on Improvement in Grave Administration for Effective Land Use ? Focused on Comparative Approach of Funeral System -,"Registration of grave establishment,Reduction of grave area,Diversification of permissible period for grave use,Register of grave,Public notice of graves,분묘설치 신고,분묘면적 축소,분묘설치기간 다양화,묘적부,분묘공시제도,공시적 효력","비교법적 고찰을 통해 일본, 중국 등 동북아의 장묘문화와 영국, 프랑스 등 서구의 대표적 장묘문화를 분석한 결과, 묘지의 부족문제는 세계 여러 나라들이 공통적으로 직면하고 있는 과제인 것으로 나타났다. 우리나라에서도 이미 한계에 도달한 묘지 부족문제를 해결하고 국토의 효율적 이용을 통해 공공복리를 증진하기 위해서는 ‘장사 등에 관한 법률’상 분묘 관리제도를 다음과 같이 개선해야 한다.
첫재, 개인묘지 설치·변경에 대한 신고주의를 허가주의(許可主義)로 전환해야 한다. 장사법상 개인묘지의 설치·변경은 신고만 하면 되는바, 단순한 신고주의로는 묘지면적, 사용기간, 설치조건 등 준수여부에 대한 실효성 있는 행정관리가 어려우며, 묘지남설, 신고태만 등을 유발하는 원인이 되고 있다.
둘째, 분묘면적(墳墓面積)을 장례에 필요한 최소한으로 축소하고 그 설치기간(設置期間)을 다양화해서 묘지의 재활용을 높이고 중도해지로 인한 불편을 해소해야 한다. 현행 제도상 분묘 1기당 점유면적은 개인묘지 30㎡, 공설·집단묘지의 경우 10㎡(합장15㎡)까지 허용되고 있으나, 이는 우리보다도 국토공간 사정이 나은 외국 입법례에 비해 과도한 수준이다. 분묘의 설치기간도 30년으로 하고 1회에 한해 30년 연장이 가능하도록 함으로써 30년과 60년 두 가지로 제한하고 있으나, 5년, 10년, 30년, 60년 등으로 그 유형을 다양화하여 묘지의 재사용을  촉진하고 이용자의 편의를 제고해야 한다.
셋째, 분묘에 대한 정보를 공개하고 공개된 정보에 대한 공시적 효력(公示的 效力)을 부여하여야  한다. 분묘는 토지에 인위적으로 설치된 부착물이며, 특수부동산으로서 독립된 소유권의 대상이 되는 사유재산이므로 그 기지인 토지소유권과의 충돌이 불가피하다. 따라서 보건복지부「e하늘장사정보시스템」을 통하여 작성·관리되고 있는 묘적부(墓籍簿) 등재사항을 일반이 열람할 수 있도록 공개하고, 공개된 정보에 대해서는 부동산등기 및 자동차등록 등과 같은 공시적 효력을 부여할 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,나치즘 영화와 테크놀로지의 유토피아 = Nazi Cinema and the Utopia of Technology,"Nazi Cinema,Technology,Utopia,Reactionary Modernism,War Film,나치즘 영화,테크놀로지,유토피아,반작용의 모더니즘,전쟁영화","나치즘 영화와 테크놀로지의 유토피아에 대한 이 글은 나치즘과 테크놀로지의 모더니즘화, 신즉물주의의 전통과 파시즘 아방가르드, 아방가르드 예술로서의 문화영화와 전쟁 테크놀로지 유토피아의 표상, 전쟁영화와 테크놀로지의 유토피아를 고찰한다. 역사적 아방가르드예술을 ‘변종예술’로서 폄훼한 나치즘 영화와 예술은 신즉물주의의 테크놀로지 숭배의 전통을 받아들이면서 테크놀로지의 모더니즘화 내지는 반작용의 모더니즘을 보여준다. 자동차경주영화의 ‘교통의 토포스’와 ‘비행사의 토포스’는 이런 관점을 제시한다.
테크놀로지의 모더니즘 대표자인 에른스트 융어는 신즉물주의의 관점에서 테크놀로지 유토피아를 내세우면서 파시즘 아방가르드의 이론적 단초를 선취하고 있다. 부르주아의 데카당스를 거부하는 그의 전쟁미학은 강철형상으로서의 군인과 새로운 인간으로서 비행사를 부각시킨다. 이는 세계를 형성하는 새로운 주체로서 기계인간의 유형이다. 파시즘의 전체주의 국가이념에 부합하는 이러한 관점은 나치즘 영화에 큰 영향을 미친다.
나치즘 영화의 전쟁 테크놀로지의 유토피아는 아방가르드 예술로서의 문화영화에서 잘 나타난다. 발터 루트만과 빌리 칠케의 산업영화와 군사 및 전쟁영화뿐만 아니라 공군영화는 이에 해당한다. 마틴 리클리의 공군영화 <비행사, 무선통신사, 포병>과 <바다로 향한 비행사>는 그러한 예이다.
그리고 나치즘 영화에서 테크놀로지의 유토피아는 비행사 토포스를 제시하는 새로운 영화로서의 극영화인 전쟁영화에서 잘 나타난다. 하인츠 파울의 공군영화 <비행의 경이로움>에서 시작되면서 영원한 젊음과 유형성숙의 모티브를 강하게 부각시키는 전쟁영화는 칼 리터의 <급강하 전투기>, 알프레드 바이드만의 <젊은 독수리> 등에서 잘 고찰할 수 있다. 시대영화인 이러한 전쟁영화는 영웅적 보도영화로서 신화적 층위에서 영웅숭배를 부각시킨다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

연구결과 공급자의 흡수역량은 신제품 개발성과와 긍정정 관계가 있었으며, 구매자의 지식보호성향은 신제품 개발성과와 부정적 관계가 있는 것으로 밝혀졌다. 아울러 공급자의 흡수역량과 구매자의 지식보호성향이 신제품 개발결과에 상호작용 효과를 갖는 것으로 나타났다. 이러한 결과는 신제품 공동개발 시 공급자의 흡수역량이 중요한 요소로 작용하지만, 우수한 흡수역량을 가진 공급자라도 구매자가 지식 전달에 부정적인 자세를 가질 경우 신제품 개발성과에 부정적 영향을 미칠 수 있음을 시사한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그러나 해양사고, 특히 도선사고는 여러 가지 해기적 및 도선 특성상 사고의 원인 규명이 불가능하거나 쉽지 않은 경우가 다수 있을 수 있다. 그런데도 해양안전심판원은 해양사고의 정확한 원인 규명을 할 수 없거나 현실적으로 어려운 사건의 해양사고관련자에게 직무상 과실이 있다고 추정하여 징계재결을 내리는 사례들이 나오고 있는 것이 사실이다.








징계재결은 면허취소, 업무 정지, 견책이 있으며 업무 정지 이상의 징계재결은 해양사고관련자에게는 형사벌에 못지않은 손실과 고통을 주게 된다.








그러므로 해양사고관련자의 업무상 과실을 인정하기 위해서는 형사상 과실범에 준하는 객관적 및 주관적 주의의무를 기준으로 사고 발생의 예견 가능성 및 회피 가능성을 검토하고, 행위와 결과 사이의 인과관계 및 객관적 귀속의 원칙에 따라 사고결과를 행위자에게 물을 수 있는 비난 가능성이 있는 경우에만 징계재결을 하여야 한다.

기존의 아트 콜라보레이션이 산업과 마케팅이 중심으로 진행된 것과 다르게, 순수예술이 중심으로 있는 아트 콜라보레이션으로는 유니레버와 테이트 모던과 현대자동차의 문화예술산업을 사례로 들고 있다. 사례로 둔 두 사업은 지속적으로 콜라보레이션을 유지하고 있고, 산업적 생산이나 홍보의 차원을 넘어 아티스트뿐만 아니라 기업과 소비자들에게도 새로운 가능성을 열어주고 있다. 로절린드 크라우스가 동시대 예술에서 현재적 상황을 진단하면서 포스트 매체의 조건으로 “매체를 재창안하기”를 선언한 것을 기반으로 한다면, 아트 콜라보레이션의이러한 과정은 ‘아트 콜라보레이션’이라는 새로운 매체가 될 수 있는 가능성 역시 보여준다. 그리고 이러한 대규보 자본을 바탕으로 한 사례들의 초석에는 산학협력형 아트 콜라보레이션을 위치시킬 수 있을 것이다. 이에연구자가 진행했던 홍익대학교 회화과와 한독제약의 산학협력 사례를 그 근거를 두고, 교육의 측면 외에도 미학적 가치도 도출할 수 있음을 밝힌다. 이를 바탕으로 순수예술과 협력한 아트 콜라보레이션이 장기적으로 이루어지기 위해서는 이것의 미학적 함의를 재고하고, 산학협력의 과정이 이것의 지평을 넓혀줄 수 있는 하나의 방법이 아닐까 제시한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,2017년도 보험법 판례의 동향과 그 연구 = Study on the Insurance Law Cases of 2017,"Insurer’s Subrogation,Liability Insurance,Duty to Explain,Duty to Disclose,Fraud,Intention,Gross Negligence,Direct Claim of Victim,Inheritance of Claim,보험자대위권,책임보험,설명의무,고지의무,사기죄,고의,중과실,피해자 직접 청구권,보험금청구권 상속","이 글은 2017년도 보험법 분야의 판례들을 다루었다. 2017년도에도 다수의 보험법 판례가 나왔으며 그 중에는 중요한 판결들의 의으를 살펴보면 아래와 같다.
첫째, 사기죄의 기망행위를 고지의무 위반의 문제와 연관시키는 것에 대하여는 보다 검토가 필요하다. 고지의무제도가 보험소비자에게 지나치게 가혹하여 전반적인 개선의 과정에 있는 점 등 여러 제반 사정을 감안할 때, 고지의무위반에 대한 보증인적 지위의 부여와 그 부작위범의 동가치성이라는 논리 전개가 타당한 지 여부에 대한 심도 있는 논증이 필요하다.
둘째, 책임보험에서의 중복보험과 구상권에 관한 판결로 그 결론은 옳다. 그러나 공동불법행위자의 보험자인 甲이 다른 공동불법행위자의 보험자에 대하여 행사하는 구상권의 법리를 피해자 직접청구권으로 설명한 부분은 적절하지 않다. 그 보험자인 甲이 대위취득하는 권리는 손해배상청구권이 아니라 구상권이고, 이는 시효기간 등이 전혀 달라지기 때문에 법적 성질에 대한 정확한 이해가 필요하다.
셋째, 법정상속인이 보험금수익자로 지정되었고 그 상속인이 수인 있는 경우 상속인 각자가 그 상속분의 비율에 따라 보험금청구을 취득한다는 판결은 타당하다.
넷째, 자동차손해배상보장법상 면책사유인 승객의 고의를 승객의 자유로운 의사결정에 기하여 의식적으로 행한 행위에 한정된다고 한 판결은 타당하다. 다만 인보험에서의 면책사유인 고의를 “전체적으로 보아 고의로 평가되는 행위로 인한 것”이라 하면서 양자 고의의 의미가 구별된다는 취지의 판시는 적절치 않은 것으로 본다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KIST의 철강공업에 대한 가장 중요한 기여로는 1969년에 있었던 신사업계획의 수립을 들 수 있다. 신사업계획은 종합제철사업계획 연구위원회가 마련했으며, KIST의 김재관과 윤여경이 이를 주도했다. 신사업계획은 규모의 경제, 설비의 구성, 제철소의 확장가능성 등의 측면에서 우수한 내용을 담고 있었다. 신사업계획을 바탕으로 한국은 일본과의 협상을 추진하여 포항제철소 건설사업을 현실화할 수있었다. 포항제철의 공식 기록은 오랫동안 신사업계획을 KIST가 주도했다는 점에 대해 언급하지 않다가 최근에 들어서야 이를 수용하는 모습을 보였다. 이로써 KIST의 연구진이 신사업계획을 주도했다는 점은 KIST의 주장에 머물지 않고 포항제철도 인정하는 사실이 되었다.
신사업계획의 수립 이외에도 KIST는 일본과의 실무협상 추진, 제철소 운영에 대비한 예비조사, 일본 기술자를 활용한 기술자문 등을 통해 포항제철소 건설사업을 적극 지원했다. 이처럼 KIST의 한국 철강공업에 대한 기여는 계획수립, 실무협상, 기술지원 등을 망라하는 총체적인 성격을 띠고 있었다. 이에 반해 기계공업, 조선공업, 자동차공업 등과 같은 다른 중공업분야의 경우에는 KIST의 역할이 주로 계획수립의 차원에 머물렀던 것으로 판단된다",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

우리나라의 항공기산업이 여타 산업에 비해 저조한 성장세를 보이고 있는데 국가 경제규모를 비롯하여 관련 산업의 발달 수준, 항공기 기술 수준, 항공기 제조 수요 등의 변수를 적절히 사용할 수 있는 시장구조를 구축하지 못했기 때문이라고 볼 수 있다. 대부분의 산업은 경쟁체제의 시장구조 하에 민간이 주도하여 성장하지만, 항공기산업과 같은 중공업은 막대한 규모의 초기 투자비용과 높은 기술력, 충분한 양의 수요를 확보하여야만 최소한의 경제성을 유지할 수 있기에 불완전경쟁체제의 시장구조 하에 정부가 주도하여 성장하는 것이 일반적이다.
이에 우리나라의 항공기산업은 군 수요를 중심으로 하는 군용 항공기를 개발하고 양산하는 것에 집중되어 있었으나, 미국과의 BASA(Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement; 상호항공안전협정)를 체결함으로써 분위기의 반전을 도모하였다. 이에 차세대 중형항공기 개발 사업을 추진하기 위한 예비타당성 조사까지 2010년에 수행되었으나 컨소시움 대상인 캐나다의 Bombardier사와 입장 차이로 인해 무산되고, 현재는 한국항공우주산업(KAI)이 단독으로 Bombardier사의 Q400 면허생산을 추진 중이며 그마저도 순탄치 않다.
이처럼 개발에 난항을 겪고 있는 중대형 민간 항공기에 비해 KAI와 항우연 등에서 민수용 헬기를 비롯하여 무인항공기, 유인항공기의 무인화 기술을 성공적으로 개발하고 있다. 또한 무인항공기 분야는 세계적으로 독점적인 영향력을 행사하고 있는 제조사가 아직까지 마땅하지 않으므로 향후 항공기산업 육성을 위해 민간용 헬기 및 무인항공기 분야에 초점을 맞추어 정부 주도의 연구개발사업을 추진할 필요가 있다고 본다.
또한 KT-1과 T-50과 같은 군용항공기도 순조롭게 수출되고 있는 추세이며, 대한민국 내 항공기 제조에 관한 최대 수요자는 군이라는 점을 간과할 수 없으므로 민군겸용 개발(spin-up), 군용기술 개발 후 민간이전(spin-off), 민간기술 개발 후 국방 분야 활용(spin-on)이 가능하도록 국가연구개발사업과 국방연구개발사업을 동시에 추진할 필요가 있다. 그러나 양 사업은 사업추진 방식과 전담부서, 기술료 제도에 있어 여러 차이점이 있다.
이에 본 연구를 통해 국가연구개발사업과 국방연구개발사업의 기술 소유권과 실시권, 그리고 기술료 제도에 대해 알아보았다. 그리고 해당 제도의 문제점을 확인하고 개선방안을 도출하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

우리나라의 현행법제는 만 19세 미만의 미성년자를 청소년보호법상의 청소년으로 정의하고 있고, 이들을 대상으로 청소년유해약물에 해당하는 주류를 판매하는 등의 행위를 금하고 있다. 도로교통법은 술에 취한 상태에서의 운전을 금지하고 있고, 만 18세 미만의 자는자동차 운전면허를 받을 수 없도록 규정하고 있다. 이러한 미성년자가 음주운전 중 타인의신체나 재물에 손해를 가하였다면 이러한 행위는 민법 제750조의 불법행위책임을 부담하는 외에 그 감독자의 주의의무 위반에 대한 불법행위책임 문제가 거론될 수 있다.
미국의 경우 운전면허 취득이 가능한 연령이 우리나라보다 낮지만 음주의 경우에는 만21세에 이르기까지 금주하는 주가 상당하며, 음주가 금지된 연령에 해당하는 자가 음주운전을 하여 사고를 야기한 경우에 그에 대한 처벌을 매우 강화하고 있다.
이러한 미국의 청소년 음주운전에 대한 제도를 검토하여 음주를 금지하는 연령을 어떻게설정할 것인지, 음주가 금지된 청소년에 대하여 어떠한 제재를 가할 수 있는지, 음주가 금지된 청소년의 음주운전에 대하여 어떻게 책임을 부과할 것인지에 관하여 그 시사점을 확인할필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ODA를 정책수단으로 하는 일본의 포괄적 안전보장 전략은 일본의 고도경제성장과 ASEAN의 경제발전을 견인했고 동아시아에서의 일본의 영향력을 강화시켰다. 1990년대 아시아금융위기와 일본의 경제위기 속에서도 일본은 대 ASEAN ODA 공여를 축소시키지 않았으며 일본 기업도 끊임없이 리스크를 분산하고 새로운 투자처를 개척하면서 ASEAN과의 분업체계와 생산네트워크를 재편해왔다. 이러한 일본의 대 ASEAN 전략은 외부적으로는 ASEAN 경제통합의 가속화, 내부적으로는 거품경제 붕괴 이후 ‘잃어버린 20’년으로부터 벗어나기 위한 새로운 성장동력의 필요성에 직면하면서 변화하기 시작한다. 2013년 아베 수상은 후쿠다 독트린에 대체하는 아베 독트린을 발표하며 새로운 ASEAN 전략으로의 전환을 알렸다. 아시아금융위기 이후 ASEAN은 역내 경제협력을 넘어 2015년 관세 철폐를 통해 ASEAN 경제통합을 실현했다. 이제 ASEAN은 경제분야 뿐 아니라 사회·문화분야, 정치분야의 통합으로 눈을 돌리면서 정책의 중심을 관세철폐에서 ASEAN의 연계성 강화와 격차 시정으로 옮기고 있다. 이러한 외적, 내적인 변화에 대응하여 일본은 국익실현과 경제재생을 목표로 아베 독트린을 추진하고 있다. 아베 독트린은 자유롭고 열린 해양을 ‘공공재’로서 강조하고 한편 ASEAN 통합의 심화와 일본의 경제재생을 연결하여 ASEAN과의 경제연계네트워크를 확대하는 것을 주요 내용으로 한다. 일본의 대 ASEAN 전략의 변화는 후쿠다 독트린에서 아베 독트린으로의 변화이며, 이에 따른 ‘평화외교’에서 ‘적극적 평화외교’, ODA의 일방적 공여에서 일-ASEAN 쌍방향의 개발협력, 분업체계· 생산네트워크의 구축과 재편에서 하드·소프트 양면에서의 ASEAN 연계성 증진으로의 전환이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

기업과 미술관의 협업은 오랫동안 이루어져 왔다. 기업이 미술관과 협업을 추진하는 이유는 다양하다. 그 중 하나는 기업 브랜드 이미지를 프리미엄으로 바꾸기 위해서 이다. 본고에서는 이미 프리미엄 이미지를 가지고 있던 벤츠와 1970년대부터경쟁하여 현재의 BMW를 존재하게 한 문화마케팅 사례를 살펴보고자 한다. 현재그들이 협업하고 있는 런던의 테이트 모던 미술관과의 협업을 중심으로 그들의 문화마케팅 전략과 방식을 구체적으로 살펴보고자 한다. 런던의 테이트 모던 미술관은 미술관으로서는 처음으로 자신의 브랜드화를 위해 다른 기업과 마찬가지로 로고를 제작하고 미술관의 브래드화를 위해 노력해왔다. 그 성공으로 지금은 현대미술을 위한 미술관으로서 세계적인 명성을 얻고 있다. 이미 프리미엄 이미지를 확보한 BMW는 이와같은 문화마케팅을 현재까지 해오고 있을지에 대해서도 분석해 보고자 한다. 이를 토대로 2011년 “모던 프리미엄”이라는 브랜드 아이덴티티를 선언하고 이를 위해 노력하고 있는 현대자동차의 사례에 관심을 갖고 분석했다. 이 두기업은 런던의 테이트 모던 미술관과 10년 이상의 장기 프로젝트로 전시와 라이브방송을 후원하고 있다.
무엇보다 본 연구에서는 이들 기업이 미술관과의 협업에서 자신들의 브랜드 아이덴티티를 어떻게 연결하고 있는지 그들의 전시 프로젝트에서 선택한 아티스트와 아티스트의 작품이 가지고 있는 콘셉트와 주제, 이야기들을 상세하게 분석하여살펴보았다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(주)삼성전자나 (주)현대자동차 같은 대형 주식회사는 수적으로는 예외중의 예외이다. 즉 상업등기부에 등기된 회사형태중 90%이상은 전형적인 주식회사가 아니며 실체를 조명해보면 합명회사 형태의 조합형 회사 아니면 극단적으로는 1인회사 내지 사실상의 1인회사인 이른바 조합형 내지 개인기업형 회사인 것이다. 주주명부를 통하여 권리행사가능 주주를 획일적으로 정하는 그런 처리방식은 모든 회사형태에 공통적으로 나타나는 회사법의 공리(公理)가 아니다. 소규모 주식회사와 같은 폐쇄형 회사에서는 그런 류의 획일주의는 뿌리를 내리기 어렵다. 적용하고 싶어도 토양이 갖추어지지 않는 것이다. 그런 회사에 있어서는 권리의 귀속과 권리의 행사를 결별시킬 이유가 없다. 먼저 권리의 귀속을 따져 보고 그 다음 권리행사 가능자를 결정하는 본래의 원칙으로 돌아가야 한다. 모든 국민은 영업의 자유를 가지며 그 속에는 법형태 선택의 자유도 포함된다. 더구나 상법은 주식회사라는 법형태에서도 소규모 주식회사를 별도로 마련해 놓고 있다. 단지 주식회사라는 법형태를 선택했다는 이유 만으로 모든 주식회사에 대해 획일주의를 강행할 수는 없을 것이다. 결론적으로 상장사에 대해서는 본 전원합의체 판결의 다수의견이 그러나 비상장사에 대해서는 소수의견과 보충의견이 더 설득력이 있다고 본다. 국내 주식회사가 가지는 단체성의 정도에 따라 이렇게 나누어 판단하는 것이 바람직할 것이다,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,코로나 19에 대응한 한국의 감세조치 및 중국에 대한 계시 = Tax Cut Measures Adopted by South Korea under the Coronavirus Pandemic and Its Enlightenment to China,"新冠病毒疫情,??,?收特例?制法,??措施,?示,Coronavirus pandemic,South Korea,The Special Tax Treatment Control Act,Tax cut measure,Enlightenment,코로나 19,한국,조세특례제한법,감세조치,계시","신종 코로나 바이러스(Covid-19)는 전 세계적으로 확산되고 있으며 오늘날지구상에 사는 모든 사람과 전 세계에 심각한 영향을 미치고 있다. 한국국회는전염병으로 인한 심각한 경제 상황에 효과적으로 대처하기 위해 3월초 세법개정을 시작하고 3월 17일 <조세 특례제한법>을 통과시켰다. 이 법안에서는다음과 같은 구체적인 세금 감면 조치를 규정하고 있다.
첫째로, 조세특례제한법 제99조의11의 규정에 의하면 특별재난지역으로 지정된 대구와 경북 경산·봉화·청도에 소재한 중소기업에 올해 1년간 중소기업 특별세액감면 최대 감면율(15~30%)의 2배 수준으로 소득세와 법인세를 감면한다. 소기업은 60%, 중기업은 30%의 감면율이 적용되며 유흥주점업과 부동산 임대업을 제외한 모든 업종에 적용된다. 국회의원의 추산에 따르면 총 13 만명이 3,400억원의 세금 감면 혜택을 볼 것이라고 한다.
둘째로, 조세특례제한법 제108조의4의 규정에 의하면 영세 자영업자는 부가가치세 납부세액을 간이과세자 수준으로 경감한다. 이를 적용 받는 소규모 개인사업자의 기준은 연 매출 8,800만원 이하이며 감면 적용 기간은 1년이다. 이에 따라 116만명의 개인사업자가 7,100억원의 세금 감면 혜택을 볼 것으로 추산된다.
셋째로, 연 매출 4800만원 미만인 간이과세자에게는 올해 한시적으로 부가가치세 납부를 면제한다. 국회의원의 추산에 따르면 17만명에서 200억원의 감면 효과가 기대된다고 한다.
넷째로, 조세특례제한법 제9조의 3의 규정에 의하면 임대인이 자발적으로임대료를 인하하는 경우 2020년 상반기(1~6월) 인하액의 50%를 임대인 소득세·법인세에서 세액공제 한다.
다섯째로, 조세특례법 제109조의 4의 규정에 의하면 2020년 3월 1일부터 6월 30일까지 기간 승용차 구매시 개별소비세 70% 한시 인하된다. 통계수치에따르면 본 감면조치가 실시된 이래 국산차 판매가 증가하고 있다. 국내 자동차판매량은 지난해보다 3월 13.2%, 4월 11.6% 증가하였다.
여섯째로, 조세특례제한법 제126조의 2의 규정에 의하면 2020년 3월부터 6 월 중 체크?신용카드 등 사용액에 대한 소득공제율을 2배 수준으로 확대한다.
이는 간접적으로 소비를 촉진하는 동시에 국민의 부담, 특히 최하위 국민의 일상적인 부담을 덜어주는 역할이 기대될 수 있다.
일곱째로, 조세특례제한법 제136조 제4항의 규정에 의하면 기업 접대비 손금산입 한도를 2020년 한시적으로 상향하였다. 이 조치로 인하여 중소기업 투자 촉진, 내수 활성화, 생산 효율 향상 등 효과를 기대할 수 있 다.
여덟째로, 조세특례제한법 제104조의 24의 규정에 의하면 2021년 12월 31일까지 한국국민이 국내에서 창업하거나 사업장을 신설 또는 증설하는 경우에는소득세 또는 법인세 감면의 혜택을 받는다.
한국의 상술한 세금감면조치는 중국에 다음과 같은 참고적 의의가 있다고본다.
첫째, 시스템 구축을 통해 조세 감면 조치의 실체적 규칙과 절차적 규칙을명확히 하고 적용 대상과 기준을 명확히 하여야 한다. 또한 예외적용을 명확히하고 그 공정성과 투명성을 보장하여야 한다. 이번 조세 감면 조치를 채택하기위해 한국이 사용한 플랫폼은 일시적인 정부 정책이 아니라 국회에서 통과된특별 법안이다. 이러한 조치의 대부분은 일시적이지만 법적 형식을 채택하여안정성과 투명성을 향상시켰고 그에 따른 정부의 시행 명령은 법원칙을 세부화하고 실시기준과 절차를 명확하게 하였다. 중  ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

이 민법전은 7개 편과 부칙으로 모두 1,260개의 조문으로 되어 있다. 각각의 편은 제1편 총칙(제1편), 물권(제2편), 계약(제3편), 인격권(제4편), 혼인가정(제5편), 상속(제6편)과 불법행위책임(제7편)이다. 최종 마련된 중화인민공화국 민법전은 그 편별체계나 조문내용에서 기본적으로 전면혁신보다는 현행법을 기본적으로 답습하면서 필요한 부분을 수정보완하는 형태를 취하고 있다.
이중에서 불법행위책임편은 민법전의 마지막 편(제7편)으로 특히 각칙편의 권리침해가 있을 경우의 일반적 권리구제방법으로서 위치하고 있다. 불법행위책임편의 각각의 장은 일반규정(제1장), 손해배상(제2장), 책임주체에 관한 특별규정(제3장), 제조물책임(제4장), 자동차교통사고책임(제5장), 의료손해책임(제6장), 환경오염과 생태환경 손해책임(제7장), 고위험책임(제8장), 사육하는 동물 손해책임(제9장)과 건물과 물건손해책임(제10장)이다. 불법행위편도 기본적으로 현행 불법행위책임법(2010년)의 규정을 기초로하면서도 약간의 규정을 신설하였고 몇몇 장의 제목이 추가되거나 변경되었다. 예를 들면 제7장은 ‘환경오염책임’에서 ‘환경오염과 생태환경 손해책임’으로 변경되었다. 이는 현대사회의 생태사회의 경향을 반영한 것이다.
특히 이 글은 향후 연구를 위하여 우리말로 조문을 모두 번역하는 것을 통하여 그 조문내용의 소개를 중점으로 한 것이다. 최신 입법례로서 우리 민법의 불법행위법의 입법론에도 좋은 시사점을 줄 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

생각건대 보험상품의 판매 과정에서 보험계약자와 밀접한 관계를 맺고 있는 보험설계사에게 고지수령권을 부정하는 것은 보험계약자 측에 가혹한 측면이 있다고 본다. 물론 보험설계사에게 고지수령권을 부여하는 경우에도 보험단체성의 원리 등에 비추어 볼 때 모든 보험상품에 대하여 이를 인정하는 것은 곤란한 점도 있다. 즉, 보험자가 보험인수에 앞서 피보험자 등의 위험요소에 대해 별도의 심사절차를 거치는 경우라면 보험설계사에게 고지수령권을 전면적으로 인정하기는 어렵다 할 것이다. 그러나 생명·질병·상해보험상품의 ‘무진단보험’의 경우에는 보험자가 위험요소를 질문표에 기재된 바에 따라 판단하면 되기 때문에 보험설계사의 고지수령권을 인정하더라도 무방하다고 본다. 아울러 손해보험상품의 건물화재보험이나 자동차보험과 같이 일반적으로 정형화된 ‘가계보험’의 경우에도 보험자가 위험인수를 거부할 여지가 그리 크지 않기 때문에, 이러한 보험상품에 대하여는 보험설계사에게 고지수령권을 인정할 필요가 있다고 본다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,민속신앙 지속과 변화의 체험주의적 탐색 = An Experiential Understanding of the Succession and Transformation in Folk Religions,"신,민속신앙,무속신앙,가택신앙,마을신앙,무형문화재,굿당,고사문화,문화유산,God,Folk Religions,Shamanism,Household Gods,Village Rituals,Intangible Cultural Heritages,Gut-dang,Gosa Culture,Cultural Heritage","인간은 세계와 지속적으로 상호작용하는 존재이고, 마음이 몸의 확장이듯이, 신은 세계의 기호적 확장이다.
신은 세계와 분리된 존재가 아니라 세계와 지속적으로 상호작용하는 존재이고, 자연·사회·역사 등의 영향을 받은인간의 삶에 근거한 기호적 존재이다. 따라서 인간과 신의 의사소통이 인간의 욕망을 충족시켜 주는 실천적 활동으로서 기호적 활동이고, 그것은 다름 아닌 제의를 의미한다. 제의적 의사소통은 인간 삶에 근거한 제물, 몸짓, 소리,언어 등 다양한 방식으로 표현하는 내용으로 구성된다. 제의 방식이나 신앙인의 태도를 기준으로 보면 민속신앙은현세구복적인 신앙이고, 현재 삶의 문제를 해결하는 것이 가장 큰 목적이다. 따라서 민속신앙이 생업 방식이농업노동에서 산업노동으로 변화되고, 인구가 집중된 도시와 조직화된 종교가 발달하면서 많은 변화를 겪을 수밖에없다.
먼저 무속신앙의 마을굿과 개인굿이 ‘무형문화재로서 굿’과 ‘굿당의 굿’으로 변화되어 지속되고 있다. ‘무형문화재로서 굿’이 물리적 전승기반인 보존회나 공공 공동체의 지원을 통해 무속신앙적 의미가 문화재적이고 공연예술적 가치로 기호적 전이되어 지속되고 있다. 그리고 ‘굿당의 굿’은 1980년대 본격적으로 형성되기 시작한굿당 중심으로 지속되고, 굿이 가정에서 굿당으로 이동하면서 많은 변화가 이루어졌다. 그것은 굿하는 시간의변화, 무당이 모셔야 할 신격과 굿하는 분위기가 변화되었다. 가정에서 가택신이었지만, 굿당에서는 산신과 용왕신이 중요한 신격이고, 특히 호남의 가정에서 세습무가 주관하는 굿이 축제적인 분위기에서 이루어지지만, 굿당에서세습무·강신무·법사의 굿은 소규모 인원만 참여하여 주술성을 강조하는 경우가 많다. 이처럼 개인굿의 물리적전승기반으로 장소가 중요한 역할을 하고 있음을 알 수 있다. 오늘날 부적의 신앙적 의미가 돌탑쌓기를 비롯하여주술적인 행동과 장신구 착용에서 지속되고 있기 때문에 무속신앙의 관점에서 관심을 가져야 한다.
두 번째로 가택신앙이 고사문화로 지속되고 있다. 가택신앙은 가정의 각 공간에 좌정한 가택신에게 가족의안녕과 풍요를 기원하는 현세구복적인 신앙이다. 가택신 가운데 성주신과 조왕신이 중요한 신격이고, 농업노동을근거로 한 확장지향형 주거 공간 생활이 물리적 전승 기반이다. 특히 분할지향형 공간 인식을 토대로 한 아파트와같은 밀집형 주거공간이 마을의 주거 공간 구조에도 영향을 미치면서 가택신앙의 관념이 약화되기도 했다. 하지만가택신에 대한 고사는 다양한 현세구복적인 고사문화로 지속되고 있다. 즉 성주고사에서 집들이로, 터주고사에서 토목건축 착공식으로, 시루고사에서 개업식으로, 뱃고사에서 자동차고사로의 기호적 전이가 이루어져 다양한 고사문화가 지속되고 있는 것이다.
세 번째로 마을신앙이 문화유산으로서 계승, 무형문화재의 지정과 연계 그리고 전통마을 만들기 차원에서 지속되고 있다. 마을신앙에 대한 문화유산의 계승적 태도가 농업노동과 공간상의 운동 경험에 근거한 ‘시간은 이동이자지속’의 시간관념을 토대로 이루어졌고, 마을제사 지내는 시간이 밤에서 낮으로의 이동은 산업노동을 근거로 한‘시간이 자원이자 돈’의 시간관념이 영향을 미친 것이다. 또한 무형문화재로 지정되거나 연계된 마을신앙이 보존회나 공공 공동체라는 물리적 전승기...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,?조선오물소제령? 실시 전후의 경성부 청소행정의 구성과 운영 = Organization and Operation of Cleaning Administration in Kyungseong City Government Before and After ?The Joseon Waste Removal Act?,"The Joseon Waste Removal Act(朝鮮汚物掃除令),Kyungseong City Government,Cleaning section,Cleaning Administration,조선오물소제령(朝鮮汚物掃除令),경성부(京城府),청소과(淸掃課),청소행정","이 글은 일제하 도입된 근대청소제도와 식민지 당국이 펼친 청소행정에 대한 검토를 통해 도시청소제도의 연원을 밝히고자 한 연구이다.
통감부시기 일본의 영향력이 커지고 일본식 제도가 도입되는 과정에서 도시 내 오물청소방식도 그 영향을 받게 되었다. 1908년 서울에서 ?제예규칙(除穢規則)?이 제정되면서 서울의 주민들은 공공단체의 청소작업에 수수료를 내고, 청소규정들을 의무적으로 따라야 했다. 1914년 부제(府制) 시행과 함께 기존 한성위생회(漢城衛生會)의 청소작업은 경성부로 이관되었다. 경성부는 한성위생회가 있던 시절의 제예사무소(除穢事務所)의 지소와 처분장을 이어받아 사용하였다. 경성부 위생계 및 위생과가 시기별로 청소행정을 담당했고 1933년부터 소제감독장(掃除監督長)이 따로 임명되었다.
1936년 일제하 전조선 통일의 청소법인 ?조선오물소제령(朝鮮汚物掃除令)?이 제정되었다. 이 법으로 청소의무, 이원(吏員)의 설치와 권한, 대집행(代執行)과 수수료 징수의 근거 등이 마련되었다. 이것은 도시의 청소를 공공행정의 영역으로 법제화한 것이었다. 경성부는 ?조선오물소제령? 시행과 함께, 법령에 의거한 청소행정에 대한 조례 등을 공포하였다.
1938년 4월 1일부로 총무부 위생과에 속했던 청소계는 총무부 청소과로 승격하였다. 1936년 경성부역의 확장 이후 청소 작업구역도 확대되고, ?조선오물소제령?이 제정되는 등 도시 청소의 중요성이 더해지면서 독립하게 된 것이었다. 초기 청소과는 서무계?징수계?종말처리계로 업무가 나뉘고, 산하에 청소과출장소와 분실, 오물처분장, 자동차차고를 두었다. 한편, 경성부는 주민들이 배출한 오물의 수거를 위해 많은 청소인부를 고용할 필요가 있었다. 이러한 문제를 타개하고자 청소과는 경성부 각 행정기구에 협력을 요청하고 주민자치조직을 동원한 새로운 청소방식을 도입하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020년 2월 중국에서 시작된 코로나19는 우리에게 예기치 않게 다가왔다. 크로나19 팬데믹은 비즈니스와 경제 그리고 우리 사회에 유례없는 충격을 주고 있다. 코로나19로 인하여 대면의 비즈니스 방식은 인터넷이나 모바일, 플랫폼 등을 통한 비대면거래 중심으로 급속하게 변모하고 있고, 밀착된 거리에서 친밀도를 유지하는 것을 당연시 하였던 인간관계는 일정한 거리를 두면서 생활해야 하는 사회적 거리를 요구하고 있다.
제4차 산업혁명의 핵으로 자리매김하면서 발전을 계속하고 있던 인공지능은 코로나19라고 하는 돌발적인 변수로 인하여 그 속도를 배가하고 있는 모습이다. 물론, 모바일이나 인터넷 등의 발전이 인공지능의 효과를 증대시키고 있는 것도 사실이다.
인공지능의 출현과 발전은 우리의 삶의 질을 윤택하게 해 줄 뿐더러 기존에 적응하였던 사고의 틀을 달리 생각하도록 요구하고 있다. 의료분야에서 논란이 되고 있는 원격의료의 논쟁에서부터 인공지능을 통한 환자에 대한 진료, 더 나아가 인공지능 의사의 출현 등의 상상은 다시 한 번 인간의 생명을 일깨워주고 있다. 대면을 원칙으로 하는 의사의 진료행위 주장에는 환자의 안전성에 토대를 두고 있다. 하지만 기술의 진보로 환자의 안전성 보장을 담보할 수 있는 상황이라면, 원격의료를 반대하는 주장은 하나의 우려사항일 뿐이다.
인간과 동물이 가지고 있는 지능을 자연지능이라고 한다면, 이러한 자연지능을 컴퓨터에 실현시키는 정보처리 메카니즘이 바로 인공지능이다. 약한 인공지능의 출현은 인간과 인공지능이 공존하는 평화의 시대를 생각할 수 있다. 하지만 인간과 마찬가지로 자율적인 의식을 가지고 프로그램 스스로 독립적인 판단을 하는 인공지능이라면, 인공지능은 인간의 단순한 도구적 기능을 하는 것으로 볼 수는 없다. 이제 인공지능은 인간과의 공존이나 평화를 유지할 수 있을까의 문제로 발전하게 될 것이다. 이미 1980년 초반 등장했던 “터미네이터”라는 기계인간을 통해서 우리는 기계와 인간이 공존할 수 없는 간접경험을 한 바 있다.
인공지능시대에도 정의로운 사회가 구현될 수 있을까에 대한 의문이 있다. 인공지능의 출현은 우리의 노동시장에서 일자리에 상당한 타격을 줄 것이다. 인공지능은 고용의 문제와 함께 사라지는 인간의 일자리와 그로 인한 소득과 분배를 어떻게 해소해야 할 것인가의 문제로 집중하게 될 것이다. 이때 정의의 관점에서 문제의 해결방안으로서 로봇세의 부과나 기본소득의 도입 등이 우리와 마주하게 될 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

그러나 국토계획법에 따른 ‘행위제한’은 국민의 재산권 행사를 제한하게 되는데, 특히 건축공학기술의 발전에 따른 건축물의 초고층화나 드론, 무인정찰기, 무인비행택시 등 토지의 상부공간을 이용하는 새로운 장치의 등장은 국토계획법상 ‘행위제한’과 같이 국민의 재산권 행사를 제한할 여지가 있음에도 불구하고 이에 대한 법적 쟁점들은 제대로 검토된 바 없다 할 것이다. 특히 재건축 아파트 단지나 제2롯데월드, 현대자동차의 글로벌비즈니스센터 등 최근에 완료되었거나 진행 중인 사례에서 볼 수 있듯이 과거와는 달리 공중공간의 입체적 이용은 국토의 이용이나 개발에 있어 더욱 중요하다 할 것이다.
이에 본 연구를 통해 국토공간의 효율적이고 입체적인 이용에 관한 논의와 관련 법적 쟁점을 분석ㆍ검토할 필요가 있다는 것을 전제로 공중공간의 고도이용 규제수단에 관한 쟁점과 공중공간 이용과 관련한 현행 법제를 중심으로 공중공간 이용법제의 쟁점에 대해 검토하고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,항공보험 가입의무에 관한 연구 = A study on mandatory insurance for aircraft operators,"항공보험,항공운송인,항공사,손해배상책임,책임한도액,무인비행장치,aviation insurance,air carrier,airline company,carrier’s liability,drone insurance,UAV","본 연구는 우리나라의 항공보험 의무가입제도의 현황을 파악하고 외국 입법례와의 비교를 통해 우리 실정에 알맞은 합리적이고 구체적인 기준을 제시하고자 한다. 이를 통해 현행 법령의 개정방향을 밝혀 개선을 유도하고 궁극적으로 적절한 항공보험으로 항공기를 이용하는 우리 국민의 안전과 재산이 담보될 수 있는 환경을 조성하는 것을 목표로 한다. 특히 2017년 새롭게 시행된 항공사업법과 그 하위법령을 검토함으로써 향후 항공보험에 관한 입법적 개선방향을 제시하고 이로써 입법적 오류, 시행착오 등을 최소화할 수 있을 것으로 본다.
사고 발생 시에 수많은 인명과 재산이 손실되는 항공사고의 전손성, 순간성, 거대성이라는 특성을 감안할 때 항공운송산업의 지속적 성장을 유지하고 피해자를 위한 원만한 배상이 가능하도록 하기 위해서는 항공운송인에 의한 적절한 항공보험의 가입과 유지가 필수적이다. 이런 측면에서 근대 사법체계의 대원칙인 계약자유의 원칙을 수정하는 항공보험 가입의무의 강제가 설득력을 가지게 되는 것이다. 다만 외국의 입법례와 비교하여 우리나라의 항공보험 가입의무에 관한 법규정은 다음과 같은 쟁점들을 중심으로 재정비될 필요가 있을 것으로 본다.
첫째, 항공운송인에 대해 적절한 수준의 항공보험의 가입과 유지를 강제하는 것은 국가의 개인에 대한 금전적 의무를 강제하는 성격을 가지게 되므로 시행규칙이 아닌 본법에 규정되는 것이 타당할 것으로 생각된다. 이와 같은 규정의 태도는 다른 외국의 입법례에서 흔히 목격되는 사항이다.
둘째, 우리 법 규정은 “국제협약에서 규정하는 책임한도액”이라는 문구를 사용함으로써 여라 가지 다양한 경우의 항공손해배상에 대응하고 있다. 하지만 본문에서 살펴본 바와 같이 국제협약 중에서 어떠한 수단(legal tools)이 사용되는가에 따라 배상범위가 달라지는 점, 오늘날 승객에 대한 손해배상을 규율하는 몬트리올 협약은 항공운송인의 과실이 있는 경우 그 책임한도액이 철폐된 점, 책임한도액이 철폐된 점, 그리고 지상 제3자의 손해에 관한 로마협약체계에는 우리나라가 가입하고 있지 않은 점 등을 고려할 때 “국제협약에서 규정하는 책임한도액”은 더 이상 만병통치약이 되지 못한다.
셋째, 우리나라와 같이 좁은 영토를 가진 국가에서는 국내운송과 국제운송이 비행시간이나 거리에서 큰 차이가 있다. 따라서 항공보험 가입의무에 있어서도 국내운송과 국제운송을 나누어 규율할 필요가 있을 것으로 본다. 이러한 이중적 규율은 항공운송업에 새롭게 진출하고자 하는 신생 항공사에게 국제운송과 같은 필요 이상의 보험가입을 강제하지 않아도 되는 장점이 있다.
넷째, 무인비행장치의 사고에 따른 항공보험에 자동차손해보험을 준용하는 것은 무인비행장치 사고에 관한 특성을 충분히 이해하지 못한 것으로 보인다. 향후 무한한 발전가능성을 가진 무인비행장치에 관한 보험은 장기적인 관점에서 일반적인 항공보험과 분리하여 규율하는 것이 타당할 것으로 생각된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

하지만 실무에서는 전체 화물의 약 32.1%가 3단계 이상 다단계 운송계약에 의해 이뤄지고 있다고 한다. 3단계 이상의 다단계 거래에서는 누가 운송인인지, 운송주선인인지 구분하기 어렵기 때문에 운송계약이 제대로 이행되지 않을 때 누가 운송인으로서 책임을 부담할 것인지 구분하기가 어렵다. 그리고 이러한 다단계 운송계약은 대기업의 물류자회사 또는 물류대기업들이 자기 회사의 영업능력과 네트워크를 활용해 자체 운송능력을 초과하는 운송계약을 체결하고, 영업능력이 부족한 영세한 운수회사에게 저가에 운송계약을 위탁, 재위탁하는 방식으로 운영된다. 이러한 다단계 운송은 운송계약을 재차 체결하면서 주선수수료 수입을 떼고, 처음 운송료의 70%를 밑도는 금액을 화물차주에게 지급하는 등 시장을 왜곡하고 있다는 문제점이 있다.

2019,반응표면법을 이용한 폐자동차 범퍼 파쇄물의 색채선별공정 최적화 연구 = Optimization of Color Sorting Process of Shredded ELV Bumper using Reaction Surface Method,"폐자동차,재활용,플라스틱 범퍼,색채선별,반응표면법","폐자동차 범퍼 파쇄물 재활용을 위하여 색채선별법을 도입하였다. 색채선별법은 기존의 비중, 입도 차이에 의한 선별이 어려운 물질을 색상 차이를 이용한 카메라와 영상 분석기법으로 분리하는 선별법이다. 본 연구에서는 반응표면법 중 BBD (Box-Behnken Design)를 적용하여 실험을 계획하고 최적 조건을 도출하였다. 색채민감도, 피드투입량 및 입자크기의 영향을 분석하였으며, 회귀분석과 통계적인 방법에 기초하여 2차 반응 모델을 획득하였다. $R^2$ 및 p-value는 각각 99.56%, < 0.001로 타당하였으며, 추정된 최적조건은 색채민감도 32%, 피드투입 200 kg/h, 입자크기 33 mm 조건에서 94.1%의 회수율이 나올 것으로 예측하였다. 실제 실험을 통한 회수율은 93.8%로 나타나 해당 모델이 적절함을 확인하였다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,자동차 급발진 추정 사고에 관한 증명책임과 손해배상책임에 관한 연구 = The Study on the Burden of Proof and the Liability for Damage Compensation on Sudden Unintended Acceleration of Automobile,"자동차 급발진 추정 사고,제조물책임법,증명책임,소제기 전 증거개시제도,비례책임제도,Sudden Unintended Acceleration(SUA),Product Liability Law,Burden of Proof,Discovery System,Proportionate Liability","「제조물책임법」 은 제조물의 결함에 따른 손해배상책임을 무과실책임으로 규정하고 「민법」 상 불법행위책임과 다른 입장을 취하고 있지만, 그 ‘결함’에 대한 증명책임이나 손해배상에 관해서는 특별한 규정을 두고 있지 않아 자동차 급발진 추정 사고와 같은 제조물책임소송에 있어서 문제점이 많았다. 이에 입법을 통해 제조물책임법 상의 징벌적 손해배상제도의 도입과 증명책임의 완화를 통한 ‘결함의 추정’을 추가하여 문제해결에 나서긴 했지만 여전히 남아 있는 과제가 있다.
  급발진 사고의 원인인 ‘자동차의 결함’에 대한 증명책임은 원칙적으로 원고측에 있는데, 증거의 편재로 인한 불평등을 해소하고자 이에 대한 전환, 완화 및 경감을 통해 그 ‘결함’의 규명 없이 추정에 의한 결함의 인정으로 손해배상 책임을 묻게 된다면, 책임을 부담하는 피고 측의 입장에서도 사실상 수긍하기 힘들 수 있다. 또한 다수의 피고들이 부진정연대책임을 지는 상황이라면 더더욱 그러할 것이다. 이러한 한계를 극복하기 위해서는 민사소송법 상 소제기 전 증거개시제도의 도입으로 원고 측과 피고 측이 증거에 있어서 대등한 상황아래에서 공방을 펼쳐나갈 수 있는 환경을 마련해야 하고, 나아가 소극적일 수 밖에 없는 피고 측의 자발적이고 적극적인 소송 참여를 유도할 수 있는 비례책임제도의 도입을 제안하고자 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,자동차 파워트레인 전쟁 - 내연기관 vs. 하이브리드 vs. 전기차 -,,"○ 2015년 폭스바겐 배출가스 조작사건 이후 자동차 환경규제가 엄격해지면서 실제로 일부 국가들은 내연기관 퇴출 정책을 입안 중
- 노르웨이는 2025년부터 내연기관 판매를 금지하고 100% 플러그인 전기차만 판매하도록 하는 법안에 합의, 네덜란드, 독일과 인도는 2030년, 영국과 프랑스는 2040년부터 내연기관 판매금지 정책을 추진하겠다고 밝혀 확산 조짐
- 이러한 가운데 전기차는 지난해 122만 대가 판매되고 신차 시장의 1.3%까지 성장하며 파워트레인 시장 재편 기대감을 심어주었고, 48V(볼트) 하이브리드 시스템, 수소연료전지차가 시장에 선보이며 소비자 선택폭 확대
○ 독일 완성차 업체 중심으로 배출가스 조작사건이 연이어 노출되면서 디젤엔진은 소비자 이미지 크게 실추, 내연기관 시장 전체가 돌파구 고민 중
- 가솔린 시장에서는 터보차저, 다운사이징이 일반화되었으며, 가변압축비 엔진 등 신기술로 최근 열효율 40%를 넘어서면서 향후 60%대 열효율까지 기대
- 디젤엔진은 강화된 배출가스 규제에 맞추어 DPF, SCR 등 미세입자(PM)와 질소산화물 후처리 장치 장착으로 대응 중이나 추가 장치와 비용은 소비자에게 부담으로 작용
○ 비용대비 효과 높은 하이브리드가 단기적으로는 가장 현실적인 대안으로 고려되고 있으며, 최소의 시스템으로 큰 효과 누릴 수 있는 48V 시스템 부상
- 내연기관 개선만으로는 한계가 있어 기존 플랫폼을 활용하면서도 상대적으로 적은 비용에 구현 가능한 하이브리드가 현실적 대안으로 부상, 일부 시장 주도
- 유럽에서는 특히 구동모터나 복잡한 기어장치가 필요 없는 48V 시스템이 각광받을 것으로 예상하고 부품업체들이 기술 개발에 주력
○ 자동차 파워트레인 시장 구성을 좌우하는 결정인자는 플러그인 전기차 시장의 확산속도인 것으로 보이며, 전대강자 없는 춘추전국시대 지속 예상
- 글로벌 지구온난화 공동대응으로 인해 자동차 환경규제 갈수록 강화, 완성차 업계는 이에 맞추어 공격적인 전동화 전략을 발표하고 실제 다수의 모델 개발
- 하지만 아직 배터리 가격 및 수급불안 해소, 충전인프라 확보, 재생에너지 확대 통한 전력그리드 친환경성 향상 등 많은 과제를 안고 있음
→ 파워트레인 시장은 하나의 기술이 시장을 지배하기보다는 지역특성에 맞게 다수의 대안이 분포하며 소비자 선택의 폭이 넓어지고 다변화될 전망",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,일감몰아주기와 회사기회유용 실태분석,,"▣ 경제개혁연구소(소장: 김우찬)는 2006 년 경제개혁연대가 “대규모기업집단의 문제성 주식거래에 대한 보고서”를 발표한 이후 지속적으로 “대규모기업집단의 일감몰아주기 및 회사기회유용에 대한 보고서” 및 이로 인한 동일인등의 부의 증가보고서를 발표해 오고 있음
   ○ 그 동안 발표된 보고서들은 주요 일감몰아주기 및 회사기회유용 회사들 그리고 이로 인한 동일인등의 부의 증가를 중심을 기술되어 있으며, 본 보고서는 일감 몰아주기 및 회사기회유용을 기업집단별로 기술하고자 함
  ▣ 분석방법 등은 다음과 같음
   ○ 분석대상회사 : 2018 년 공정위가 지정한 공시대상기업집단 중 동일인이 존재하는 52 개 기업집단 소속 1,924 개 회사
   ○ 일감몰아주기 판단기준 : 동일인등이 직간접적으로 20% 이상의 지분을 보유한 회사 중 국내계열회사에 대한 매출이 총 국내매출의 20% 이상인 경우
   ○ 회사기회유용 판단기준 : 동일인등이 직간접적으로 20% 이상의 지분을 보유한 회사 중 계열회사와 동일한 업종을 영위하는 등 회사기회를 유용한 경우
  ▣ 분석결과는 다음과 같음
   ○ 52 개 기업집단 중 일감몰아주기 및 회사기회유용(이하 ‘일감몰아주기등’ 이라 함) 회사가 없는 기업집단은 20 개 그리고 1 개 이상의 일감몰아주가등이 있는 회사가 있는 기업집단은 32 개임. 일감몰아주기등이 없는 20 개 기업집단 중 13 개 기업집단은 과거에 경제개혁연대 및 연구소에서 일감몰아주기등 회사로 판단하지 않았던 기업집단이며 7 개 기업집단은 일감몰아주기등을 해소한 기업집단임
   ○ 52 개 기업집단 소속 1,924 개의 계열회사 중 일감몰아주기가 있는 회사는 76 개사(전체 계열회사 1,924 사의 3.95%)이며, 회사기회유용회사는 27 개사임. 또한 중복회사(일감몰아주기 회사이며 회사기회유용인 회사)를 1 개 회사로 계산하면 일감몰아주기등에 해당되는 회사는 95 개사로 이는 전체 계열회사 1,924 개사의 4.94%에 해당 함
   ○ 76 개의 일감몰아주기 회사 중 현행공정거래법상 규제대상 회사는 26 개사 이며 공정거래법 개정 TF 의 권고안에 따른 규제대상 회사는 65 개사 임
   ○ 1,924 개의 회사 중 동일인등이 직접 20% 이상의 지분을 보유한 회사는 264 개사이며 이중 일감몰아주기등에 해당되는 회사는 53 개사로 20.08%에 해당되며, 동일인등이 직간접적으로 20% 이상의 지분을 보유한 회사 815 개 중 일감몰아주기등에 해당되는 95 개사는 11.66%에 해당됨
   ○ 과거 경제개혁연대 및 경제개혁연구소가 일감몰아주기등으로 판단했던 회사 179 개사 중 2018 년 기업집단 소속 계열회사는 141 개사로 103 개사는 이번 보고서에서 일감몰아주기등으로 판단하지 않았음. 34 개사는 피합병, 19 개사는 지분매각(또는 증여)으로 제외되었으며, 해산된 회사는 13 개사 그리고 계열분리된 회사는 3 개사, 내부거래 축소로 제외된 회사는 13 개사 그리고 기준변경에 따라 제외된 회사는 21 개사 임
  ▣ 공정거래법 개선방안은 다음과 같음
   ○ 일감몰아주기등과 관련된 규제대상회사의 선정기준을 확대 강화해야 함. 즉 공정위 TF 가 동일인등이 20% 이상의 지분을 보유하고 있는 회사가 50% 이상의 지분을 보유하고 있는 경우도 규제대상으로 확대하도록 권고 한 것은 긍정적이나, 이외 다양한 방식으로 동일인등이 직간접적으로 상당한 지분을 보유할 수 있으므로 이러한 회사에 대한 규제도 필요함
   ○ 현행 공정거래법의 20% 기준은 발행주식총수를 기준으로 하고 있는 바, 동일인등이 수취하는 이득의 정도를 파악하는 것이 목적이라면 현금흐름권이 없는 자사주를 제외하고 지분율을 계산하는 것도 고려해야 함
   ○ 대한항공의 일감몰아주기와 관련된 판결을 살펴 보면 법원은 “특수관계인에게 부당한 이익을 귀속시키는 행위”인지 여부는 ‘사익 편취를 통한 경제력 집중이 발생할 우려가 있는지’의 맥락에서 살펴야 한다고 판결하여 공정거래법의 일감몰아주기 규제를 사실상 무력화시켰는 바, 공정거래법에 부당한 이익의 개념을 보다 명확히 할 필요가 있음
   ○ 현행 공정거래법은 금호아시아나그룹과 같이, 공익법인을 통해 지배하고 있는 일감몰아주기 회사에 대한 규제방안도 강구하여야 함
   ○ 기업집단뿐 아니라 비기업집단에서도 일감몰아주기등을 통한 사익추구가 만연해 있는 상황에서 모든 기업을 대상으로 일감몰아주기 규제가 이루어져야 함",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,2019 대기업집단 감사위원 분석,,"○ 현행 상법은 감사위원 중 1 인은 회계/재무전문가일 것을 요구하고 있다. 하지만 2019 년 주주총회 의안을 검토해본 결과 회계/재무전문가인 감사위원을 명시한 경우를 찾기 어려웠으며 심한 경우는 기존의 감사위원과 신규로 선임되는 감사위원 중 회계/재무전문가가 없어 보이는 경우도 있었다. 이는 공시서식이 사업보고서에서는 회계재무전문가에 대한 기재를 하도록 하나, 주주총회 공고에서는 관련 내용을 기재하는 부분이 없으며, 상장규정 역시 엄격하게 적용되지 않기 때문으로 보인다.
  ○ 60 개의 상호출자제한기업집단 및 공시대상기업집단 중 56 개의 기업집단이 262 개의 상장회사를 보유하고 있으며 이 중 감사위원회가 설치된 회사는 53 개 기업집단의 199 개 회사로 삼성그룹이 13 개의 회사에 감사위원회를 설치하고 있으며 SK, LG, 현대자동차그룹이 11 개, 롯데와 KT그룹이 9 개 순으로 나타났다. 이들 회사는 총 638 명의 감사위원을 선임하여 회사당 3.2 명의 감사위원을 두고 있으며 82%에 달하는 164 개의 회사는 3 명의 감사위원만 선임하여 법적인 최소요건만 만족하고 있다.
  ○ 상법의 시행령에서는 회계재무전문가를 네가지로 구분하고 있는데, 1) 공인회계사 2)회계/재무분야의 교수 및 연구원 3) 상장회사에서 회계/재무 업무에 종사한 기업인, 4) 국가, 금융기관, 공공기관 등에 재직한 관료 등 으로 나누어 볼 수 있다. 현재 상법시행령은 자본시장법 시행령 제 29 조 제 2 항 제 4 호를 참조하고 있으나, 해당 조항은 삭제되어 시행령의 개정이 필요하다. 또한 기업의 경우 임원 5 년, 직원 10 년인데 반해 공공기관은 5 년의 경력이면 회계/재무전문가로 인정되어 형평에 어긋나는 부분도 수정할 필요가 있다.
  ○ 회계재무전문가여부의 공시현황을 살펴보면 총 199 개 회사 중 131 개 회사가 자발적으로 회계재무전문가가 감사위원으로 재직 중에 있다고 공시하고 있다. 하지만 사업보고서 공시 이후 주주총회에서 감사위원이 변경될 때, 누가 회계재무전문가인지 파악할 수 없어 주주총회 공고에서도 이를 적극적으로 공시할 필요가 있다. 아모레퍼시픽그룹의 경우 사업보고서에 회계재무전문가여부를 모두 미해당으로 표기하여 공시하였는데 법을 어기고 있어도 실질적으로 제재하는 경우가 없어 상장규정의 엄격한 적용도 고려할 필요가 있다.
  ○ 638 명의 감사위원 중 구체적인 이력을 검토하지 않고, 직군으로 분류한 광의의 회계재무전문가는 303 명으로 199 개 상장회사에 1 인 이상이 회계재무전문가로 재직할 수 있는 수준이다. 하지만 협의의 회계재무전문가인 회계사와 회계/재무 전공 교수는 90 명으로 전체 회사의 절반 정도만 회계재무전문가를 보유할 수 있는 수준이었다.
  ○ 전체 199 개 회사 중 11 개회사는 3 명의 감사위원 모두 회계재무전문가로 보기 어려운 경우로 나타났다. 대한화섬, 대한항공, 태광산업, 코오롱인더스트리는 회계재무전문가로 경영학과 교수를 공시하고 있으나 이들은 모두 회계/재무 전공이 아니다. 신세계인터내셔날, 신세계푸드, 팜스코는 회계재무전문가를 확인할 수 없었으나 경영학과 교수가 감사위원으로 재직중이며, 3 명의 감사위원 모두 회계재무전문가의 이력을 갖추고 있지 않았다. 에스케이케미칼과 두산밥캣은 관료를 회계재무전문가로 공시하였으나 법적인 요건을 충족하지 못하는 것으로 보인다. 또한 CJ ENM, 금호산업은 회계재무전문가와 무관한 관료가 감사위원으로 선임되었다.
  ○ 광의의 회계재무전문가는 국세청 출신과 재경분야의 관료가 다수를 차지하고 있으며 회사가 회계재무전문가로 공시한 경우 역시 기업인, 국세청, 재경관료 순으로 나타났다. 기업인의 경우 회계/재무관련 업무에 종사해야지 회계/재무전문가로 인정이 가능하기 때문에 감사위원의 이력 중 해당 이력에 대해 보다 명확히 공시할 필요가 있다. 또한 계열회사 출신의 경우는 전문성이 있더라도 독립성이 부족하기 때문에 이에 대한 대책 역시 필요하다. 국세청 출신의 경우 회계/재무와 세무분야는 다르기 때문에 회계재무전문가로 볼 수 있을지 의문이며, 오히려 경제학 교수 중에는 회계재무전문가로 볼 수 있는 여지가 있으나 법적으로는 인정이 안 되는 경우가 있어 법률적 요건과 실질 사이의 합치가 필요한 부분이다.
  ○ 특히 국세청 출신이나 재경관료의 경우 한 회사에서는 회계재무전문가로 공시하지만 겸직 하고 있는 다른 회사에서는 회계재무전문가로 공시하지 않는 경우가 있어 회사마다 판단이 다른 문제가 있으며, 공직 입문 시 잠시 거친 업무를 바탕으로 회계재무전문가로 주장할 수 있는 여지가 있어 최근의 경력 조건을 추가할 필요가 있다. 무엇보다도, 법률에서 자격을 정할 것이 아니라 시장에서 적격성을 판단할 수 있도록 이들에게 실질적인 책임을 물을 수 있도록 하는 방안이 필요하다.
  ○ 이러한 문제를 개선하기 위해서는 우선 공시를 확대하여 주주총회 공고에서부터 회계재무전문가를 확인할 수 있도록 해야 하며, 시행령을 개정하여 자격요건을 수정할 필요가 있다. 또한 상법을 개정하여 감사위원의 분리선출을 도입해 시장에서 적절한 인물을 선택하게 하고 상장규정을 엄격히 적용하여 회계재무전문가가 없는 경우도 감사위원회의 설치의무 위반으로 볼 필요가 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,온라인 플랫폼의 오프라인 서비스에 대한 통제 수준에 관한 연구- EU 우버와 에어비앤비 판결이 타다 판결에 주는 시사점 - = A study on online platform’ s influence over offline services- Implications of EU’ s Uber and Airbnb Judgments on Tada case -,"영향력,우버,유럽 사법재판소,에어비앤비,정보사회서비스,타다,통제력,플랫폼,Airbnb,Control,European Court of Justice,Influence,Information Society Service,Platform,Tada,Uber","우리의 타다 판결이 플랫폼 운영자의 혁신성과 기존 산업(택시 업계)과의 경쟁 문제의 구조를 여객자동차법령 상의 예외조항에 해당하는지 여부의 문제로 검토한 반면, 최근 유럽 사법재판소(ECJ)의 우버와 에어비앤비 판결은 플랫폼 운영자의 혁신성과 기존 산업(택시 업계 또는 숙박 업계)과의 경쟁문제를 EU 지침 상 해당 플랫폼서비스가 정보 사회서비스(ISS)로 분류 가능하여 기존 산업의 규제(면허 또는 허가 등)에서 제외될 수있는지 여부의 문제로 검토하였다.
이 과정에서 우리와 EU의 판결이 공통적으로 사용한 기준이 플랫폼의 운송서비스(또는 숙박서비스)에 대한 영향력(또는 통제력) 수준이다. 그러나 비슷한 플랫폼서비스 내용과 사실관계를 두고 EU와 우리가 다르게 판단한 부분이 있어 이에 대한 면밀한 검토가 필요하다. 예컨대, 타다 판결에서 타다 기사에 대한 타다의 직접 고용이 아닌 용역업 체와의 계약과 그 용역업체의 타다 기사에 대한 통제(control) 구조 등을 제시하면서, 타다의 그 기사에 대한 느슨한 지휘·감독관계를 암시하였다. 이를 통해 타다와 그 이용 자(승객) 간 거래를 초단기 승합차 렌트로 확정하면서 우려했던 ‘타다 이용자(승객)가 타다 승합차를 임차인으로서 지배하지 못 한다’는 잠재적 반론을 반박하였다. 반면, 유럽 사법재판소(ECJ)는 담당 법무관 의견서를 통해 우버 플랫폼의 운전자에 대한 통제는 전통적인 고용주와 근로자 관계의 맥락에서 행사되는 것이 아닌, 금전적 유인과 우버 이용자(승객)가 주도하는 분권화된 평가에 기반한 간접적 통제이고 이것이 전통적 고용주와 근로자 관계에서 나타나는 공식적 명령에 따른 운영과 직접적 통제 보다 효과적이라고 주장한다. 따라서 EU 판단을 참고하여, 타다 플랫폼이 금전적 유인이나 승객 평가시 스템 등을 통해 어떻게 간접적으로 운전자의 행동(conduct), 궁극적으로 타다 기사의 퇴출에 영향을 미칠 수 있는지에 대해 검토가 필요하다.
한편, 타다 서비스의 법적 성격을 판단하는 데 타다 기사의 법적 지위(사용종속관계 여부 등)는 직접적으로 관련이 없다. 따라서 타다 판결에서 타다 승객이 그 승합차를 임차인으로서 지배하지 못한다는 잠재적 반론을 우려하여 타다의 그 기사에 대한 느슨한 지휘·감독 관계를 제시한 부분은 향후 플랫폼 노동자의 법적 지위에 대한 논의에서 판결의 취지와 다르게 확대 해석되지 않도록 해야 한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,감성광고와 ‘이야기’의 관계 연구 - 브랜드의 ‘추구 가치’를 중심으로 = A study on the relationship between the Emotional Advertisement and its story focused on the target value of brand,"감성광고, 감성, 이야기, 호모나랜스, 설득, 브랜드, 추구가치, emotional advertisement, emotion, story, Homonarans, persuasion, brand, Target value to be achieved","본 연구는 감성광고와 이야기의 관계 분석을 통해 제품과 브랜드가 추구하는 가치와 신념이 ‘이야기’와 만나 어떻게 소비자의 감성을 자극하는 가를 살펴보고자 했다. 기술의 발전과 제품의 평준화, 가격의 비차별화로 더 이상 제품의 질과 가격이 제품의 구매 결정요인이 되지 못하는 현대사회에서 제품에 담긴 이야기 즉 감성이 상품 자체가 되고 있는 점에서 본 연구의 논의를 시작하였다.
먼저 Ⅱ장에서 감성과 광고와 이야기의 관계를 살펴보았다. 이야기를 파는 감성 마케팅은 브랜드와 소비자 사이에 감성적 연결고리를 만들어 소비자의 마음속에 제품에 대한 감성적 가치를 높이는 것임을 알 수 있었다.
다음으로 Ⅲ장에서 감성 소비의 ‘주체’로서의 ‘호모나랜스’와 이야기의 감성적 소비를 통한 자기정체성 확인을 살펴보았다. 제품 자체보다는 제품을 감싸고 있는 이야기를 사는 ‘호모나랜스’-소비자는 “나는 쇼핑한다. 고로 존재한다”(I shop, therefore I am)는 명제처럼 자신의 이야기와 부합하는 제품의 이야기를 쇼핑한다. 이는 자신의 정체성을 표현하고 스스로 확인하기 위해서였다.
이어서 Ⅵ장에서는 ‘호모나랜스’의 설득의 방식으로서의 감성광고를 분석해보았다. 호모나랜스-소비자는 “적극적으로 이야기를 찾아다니며 자신과 같은 소비자의 이야기를 신뢰하고 기존 콘텐츠의 재구성을 즐기며 이야기 중심에 항상 ‘나’를 둔다는 특성”을 갖고 있었다. 따라서 호모나랜스-소비자를 설득할 수 있는 길은 그들의 이야기와 ‘접속’될 수 있는 감성적
소구의 광고가 필요하다는 것을 확인할 수 있었다. 마지막으로, V장에서는 스토리텔링을 통한 브랜드의 ‘추구가치’의 감성마케팅의 실증적 두가지 사례를 분석해보았다. 애플(Apple)의<관점>(Perspective)과 현대자동차그룹의 <재잘재잘 스쿨버스>(Chatty School Bus) 광고는 브랜드의 추구가치를 창의적으로 스토리텔링하여 소비자의 감성의 공명을 울리는데 성공한 감성광고였다. 이 두 광고는 기업이 무엇을 만드는지를 말하지 않고 왜 제품을 만드는지를 말하였다. 이를 통해 소비자는 제품 자체보다 기업이 제품을 만드는 이유(추구가치와 신념)의 이야기를 사는 감성광고의 의의를 살필 수 있었다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

하지만, 개별 특별법의 규율내용이 광역과 기초간 권한배분과 관련하여 흠결상태이거나 불명확한 경우도 존재한다. 이 때에는 일반법에 규정된 권한배분의 원칙들이 적용되어야 한다.
이 글에서는 원주시내버스운송사업의 적자보전을 위한 재정지원업무에 관하여 입법권의 관할을 놓고 강원도와 원주시가 갈등을 보이고 있는 사례를 대상으로 도와 시?군간 조례제정권의 배분기준에 관하여 분석고찰하였다.
여객자동차운수사업법은 시내버스에 대한 시의 재정지원업무에 관한 입법권의 소재에 관해 명시적인 규정을 두고 있지 않다. 하지만, 법제처는 기존에 여러 차례 유권해석을 통해 시내버스나 군내버스의 적자보전을 위한 시?군의 재정지원업무에 관해 광역자치단체에게 조례제정권이 존재함을 이유로 시?군의 조례제정권은 허용되지 않는다는 의견을 제시했었다. 법제처의 기존 유권해석의 핵심적인 논거는 여객자동차운수사업법이 사업면허권을 광역자치단체에 부여하고 있기 때문에 시?군이 재정지원하는 경우도 도의 조례로 규정해야 한다는 것이었다.(면허권설).
하지만, 특별법에서 권한배분에 관해 특별한 규정을 두지 않고 있을 때에는 일반법에 규정된 입법권의 배분원칙에 따라 권한이 배분되어야 한다는 점에서 법제처의 기존 유권해석은 의문이었다.
이 글에서는 개별 법률에서 명시적으로 조례제정권의 배분에 관해 지시하지 않을 때, 다음의 조건이 충족되면 주민복리사무에 관해 기초자치단체에게 조례제정권이 존재한다고 보아야 한다고 주장하였다.
주로 해당 지역주민의 복리에 직접적으로 영향을 미치는 사무일 것해당 지역의 관할구역내에서 대상 활동이 이루어질 것해당 기초자치단체가 단독으로 재정지출을 하거나 단독으로 그 업무를 처리할 수 있는 성질의 사무일 것이 입장을 단독관할 + 재정부담 결합설 또는 줄여서 결합설이라고 불렀다.
법제처가 대상사례에서 기존의 입장을 대전환하여 원주시에게 조례제정권을 인정하는 방향으로 새로운 해석을 제시한 것을 환영한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,형사제재로서 취업제한의 정당화 과제 = The Justification Task of Restriction on Employment as Criminal Sanctions,"취업제한,보안처분,재범의 위험성,보호관찰,준수사항,Restriction on Employment,Security measure,Danger of recidivism,probation,compliance points","형사제재로서 취업제한이 부과되면 법률에 열거되어 있는 직장이나 업무 등을 일정한 기간 동안 종사할 수 없게 된다. 이로써 대상자에게는 그 범위만큼 직업선택의 자유를 박탈당하게 되는 효과가 발생한다. 현재 형사제재로서의 취업제한을 설치한 법률은 4개이며, 부과형태를 기준으로 하면 규정에 의한 ‘자동부과형’과 법원의 ‘심사부과형’의 2가지로 대별해 볼 수 있다. 그런데 헌법재판소는 취업제한의 법적 성격을 보안처분으로 파악하고 이에 따라 자동부과형으로서 10년이라는 고정된 기간 동안 취업제한이 계속되도록 했었던 (구)청소년성보호법과 (구)아동복지법에 대하여 총 8번의 위헌결정을 내린 바 있다.
규정에 의해 의무적으로 부과되도록 한 입법형태는 취업제한을 부과하는 시점에서 재범의 위험성이 확인되지 않았는데도 무조건 직업선택의 자유를 제한한다는 점에서, 그리고 재범성의 위험성은 시기별로 가변적이고 대상자에 따라 개별적인데도 불구하고 모든 적용자에게 취업제한의 부과 기간을 획일적으로 고정해놓고 이를 예외 없이 적용하는 것 또한 재범의 위험성에 실질적으로 근거하지 않은 과도한 기본권 침해라고 판단한 것이다.
특정경제범죄법과 화물자동차법의 취업제한도 자동부과형이기 때문에 단지 헌법재판소에 위헌심판을 청구당하지 않았을 뿐 같은 이유로 위헌을 면할 수 없다. 헌법재판소의 위헌결정의 직접적인 대상이었던 청소년성보호법과 아동복지법은 2018년 개정법률을 내놓았지만, 여전히 보안처분의 정당화 조건에 부합할 수 없는 수준이다. 위험성 판단을 형벌선고시라는 과거에 고정시켜 둔 채로 중간심사 절차도 마련해 놓지 않아 취업제한의 개시시점에서 확인된 위험성에 근거할 수 없기 때문이다.
그런데 취업제한은 형사제재의 집행수단이라는 점에서 법적 성격을 이분법적 관점에 갇혀 양자택일적으로만 접근하는 것은 타당하다고 할 수 없다. 만약 취업제한의 법적 성격을 보안처분으로만 한정한다면 ‘형 일부의 집행을 종료하거나 집행이 유예된 자’에 대한 부과는 정당화될 수 없기 때문이다. 재사회화 이념이나 사회안전에 대한 현실적인 요구를 고려한다면, 가석방된 자나 집행유예자와 같이 개전의 정이 양호한 것으로 판단된 사람에 대해서도 형벌의 영역에서 취업제한을 적용할 필요성이 인정될 수 있다. 그 형태는 형벌집행 수단의 변형으로서 부과되는 보호관찰 안에서 특별준수사항의 일부로 입법하는 방안이 타당할 것이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(연구방법) 본 연구는 메세나 도시재생에서 나타나는 가치요소를 분석하고, 가치요소에 해당하는 도시재생 유형을 진정적 공간, 공공적 공간, 지속적 공간으로 나눈 후, 선행연구를 통해 공간 플랫폼 특성을 도출하여 분석하고, 메세나 도시재생의 유형별 공간에 나타나는 공간 플랫폼화 특성 및 가치를 대입하여 최근 4년 내의 국내 메세나 도시재생 사례들을 분석한다. (결과) 메세나 도시재생 유형 중 접근적, 경제적, 공생적 특성은 진정적 공간, 공유적 개방적, 상호보완적 특성은 공공적 공간 그리고 확장적, 활용적, 참여적 특성은 지속적 공간에 보여지고 있다. 또한, 선행연구를 통해 공간 플랫폼에서 나타나는 특성을 분석하여 능동성, 확장성, 참여성, 지속성, 개방성, 가변성, 공유성, 연계성, 복합성 등의 특징들을 도출하였다. 이러한 특성들을 연결 대입하여, 현대자동차그룹의 H-Village프로젝트, 신한카드의 을지로3가 프로젝트, Kiswire의 F1963,  언더독스와 SK E&S의 로컬라이즈 프로젝트를 중심으로 분석하였다. 분석한 결과 메세나 도시재생에서 공간 플랫폼화 특성은 지역경제와 문화예술을 활성화시킬 뿐 아니라, 지역 내의 기업 가치 상승이라는 선순환 구조가 나타났다. (결론) 공간 플랫폼화의 확장성을 통해 메세나 도시재생 활동에서 나타나는 플랫폼화 특성에 관해  지역과의 연계를 통해서 지역사회에 대한 이해를 향상하고, 지역 여건에 적합한 지원을 하며, 지역과의 친밀한 유대감을 조성하고, 지역 내에서의 기업 가치 상승이라는 선순환적인 구조를 만들 수 있다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Judging whether the current trend of smart car technology has the power to change the paradigm of the automobile industry is of great significance when analyzing the automobile industry. In this study, we systematically classified smart car technology based on existing literature on smart cars, various government reports and patent data, and based on this we conducted an in - depth technical analysis on smart vehicle technology using the collected patent data.
The results of the analysis are as follows. First, smart car technology has been growing rapidly since 2011. Second, if you look at smart car technology from a quantitative perspective on patent applications, GM is the most active in technology development among the existing “Big Five” makers. Toyota, Hyundai Motor Co. and Renault Nissan are top-ranked, Volkswagen is relatively lagging behind. Third, patent applications are mostly made by parts and materials manufacturers, ICT companies, and platform companies such as Google, rather than by existing car makers. Fourth, in the past, technology trends have been focused on safety-related technology, but today’s smart car technology focuses on communication related technology. This trend will further accelerate the convergence of the automobile industry and the ICT industry.
In summary, when we look at the technology application related to smart cars, the main players are those related to the ICT industry, not to the existing car makers, and from the technical point of view the technology is developing in a new area that is not the powertrain centered on engines and transmissions being the original technology of the existing automobile industry.
In the end, the convergence of industries, that is, the convergence of the ICT and the automobile industry, will change the automobile industry into a different shape in the future and it seems highly likely that the automobile industry will be reborn as a new industry called smart cars. This will certainly serve as a window of opportunity for new latecomers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018년 1월 폭스바겐사는 폭스바겐·아우디·포르쉐 브랜드의 3.0리터 디젤차량의 배기가스 조작과 관련하여 최대 2억9100만 캐나다 달러상당의 배상금에 합의하며 사실상 디젤 게이트와 관련된 모든 소송을 마무리하게 됐다. 2.0리터 디젤차량의 경우는 이미 캐나다 소비자들에게 26억 캐나다달러를 보상하거나 10만5,000여대를 재매입 및 수리하기로 합의하였다. 미국에서는 3.0리터 디젤 엔진 7만5,000대에 대해 12억 달러를 배상하기로 합의했으며, 2.0리터 엔진 50만대 차주들과는 153억 달러의 배상금을 지급하는 조건으로 소송을 마무리했다.
폭스바겐사는 세계 시장에 디젤차 1,100만대 가량을 판매했지만 디젤 게이트가 발생한 이후 미국과 캐나다에서만 법적인 책임을 인정했다. 현재 폭스바겐사는 미국과 캐나다의 소비자에게는 배상을 시행 중이며, 한국과 유럽지역에 대해서는 배상계획이 없음을 밝히고 있다.
미국과 캐나다를 포함한 영미법계 국가에서의 집단소송과 징벌적 손해배상 제도가 대규모 소비자피해에 대한 대응책으로 효과적이라는 점은 이미 이전부터 인지되어왔고 당해 폭스바겐사 자동차 배기가스 사기 사안을 해결하는 과정에서도 효과적으로 활용한 것으로 보인다. 동 사안에 관한 미국의 법적 대응은 기존의 연구가 진행되어 있기 때문에, 이 글은 폭스바겐사 자동차 배기가스 사기 사안에 대한 캐나다의 법적 대응에 초점을 두고 검토하도록 한다. 구체적으로 제II부에서 소비자보호 관련 기관과 소비자 법률 등 캐나다의 소비자 법제를 알아보기로 한다. 제III부에서는 폭스바겐사의 배기가스 사기에 대한 캐나다 연방정부와 주정부의 대응을 살펴본 후에 폭스바겐사를 상대로 제기한 소비자의 집단소송을 검토한다. 마지막으로 제IV부에서 이러한 검토를 바탕으로 우리나라에의 시사점을 도출하기로 한다.
우리나라에서 소비자소송의 실효성을 확보하기 위해서는 단체소송제도와 3배배상제도의 문제점들을 개선해야한다. 단체소송제도의 개선을 위해서는 소비자기본법 제70조의 비영리민간단체의 원고적격 요건 중에서 “50인 이상의 피해자로부터의 요청”이 있어야 한다는 부분은 삭제하고 제74조 소송허가제도도 삭제하는 것이 바람직할 것이다. 또한 소비자기본법 제70조의 소송요건 등을 완화하는 방향의 개정이 필요하다. 3배배상제도에 관해서는 소비자피해의 범위, 위법행위로 얻은 부당이득의 범위, 사업자에 대한 도덕적 비난가능성이 큰 사안에서는 손해의 범위를 3배배상에만 한정하는 것은 불합리하므로 이에 관한 개정도 함께 고려할 필요가 있다. 이러한 개선을 통하여 캐나다와 미국의 집단소송과 징벌적 손해배상 제도와 같은 효과적인 대규모 소비자피해 대응책을 마련하여야 할 것으로 사료된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TSR을 활용한 북방물류의 활성화의 기대를 현실화 할 수 있는 여건이 마련되어가는 것으로 판단된다. 그러나 TSR 루트의 경 쟁우위를 더욱 확고하게 하는데 기여할 수 있는 연간 운송수요의 확대와 고부가가치 상품의 운송 확대는 다소 한계가 있는 것으 로 판단된다. TSR을 활용한 한반도와 유라시아 지역의 연계 활성화에 대한 기대를 현실화하기 위해서는 운송의 안정성과 통관절 차의 효율화 등 지속적인 개선이 필요하다.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

연구결과 중형자동차 1대(차량가격 35,950,000원)를 렌털할 경우 아래와 같은 영향이 있을 것으로 예상된다. 첫째, 부채비율은 유가증권시장 상장기업의 경우 약 0.02%point, 코스닥시장은 0.04%point 증가할 것으로 예상된다. 둘째, 리스부채의 이자비용이 영구적 차이로 세무상 부인될 경우 세무상 조정 금액이 영업이익에서 차지하는 비율은 유가증권시장은 0.02%이며, 코스닥 시장은 0.08% 수준이다. 이때 임대규모에 따라 부채비율과 세무상 부인될 이자비용은 비례적으로 증가하며, 할인율이 낮을수록 부채비율은 높아지고, 할인율이 높을수록 세무상 부인될 이자비용은 높아진다.
업계 전문가의 인터뷰를 통해 확인된 개별 기업의 차량 렌털 수량을 감안할 때, 렌털 차량이 상당 수 있는 회사의 경우 그 영향이 적지 않을 것으로 보인다. 또한 다른 여타의 잠재적인 리스거래(e.g. 사무실 임차)까지 감안한다면 새로운 기준서로 인한 재무적 영향은 상당할 것으로 보인다. 또한 공유경제에 따른 신종 거래, 세법의 불분명성 때문에 K－IFRS 제1116호를 적용할 기업들의 실무적인 고민도 적지 않을 것으로 보인다.
본 연구는 새롭게 도입되는 K－IFRS 제1116호가 기업의 회계와 세무처리에 어떠한 영향을 줄 것인지를 보편적인 자동차의 렌털거래를 중심으로 분석하였다는 점에서 선행연구와 차별점이 있다. 그러나 자료의 한계상 모든 상장기업의 실체 차량 렌털 계약을 감안하여 분석하지 못한 것은 본 연구의 한계이다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,산재법상 출퇴근재해 인정의 문제점 - 자동차보험과의 관계를 중심으로 - = Problems in the Recognition of Commuting Accidents under Industrial Accident Compensation Act-Focusing on the Relationships with Automobile Insurance-,"commuting accidents,industrial accident compensation insurance,automobile insurance,the right to indemnity (subrogating rights),the council for indemnity amount,출·퇴근재해,산재보험,자동차보험,구상권,구상금협의회","2016년 헌법재판소의 ‘산재보험법’ 37조 1항에 대한 위헌판결로 인하여 국회에는 출퇴근재해에 대한 산업재해 인정에 관한 법안이 통과되어 2018년부터 시행하고 있다. 업무상 재해는업무와 상당인과관계가 있어야 하고 출퇴근은 업무의 시작과 종료지점에 해당하므로, 출퇴근이 없이는 업무를 시작할 수 없다. 따라서 출퇴근은 업무와 불가분적인 인과관계를 지니고 있다. 독일, 일본 등 여러 나라에서 출퇴근재해를 산업재해에 포함시켜 보호하고 있고 우리나라또한 이를 받아들여 출퇴근재해를 보호하고 있다. 출퇴근 재해를 보호하는 방법에 있어 출퇴근재해를 기존의 산업재해와 같이 보호하는 일원론과 출퇴근 재해와 기존의 산업재해를 나누어서 보호하는 이원론 등의 논쟁이 있었으나 우리나라는 독일과 같은 일원론의 입장으로서 출퇴근재해를 보호하고 있다. 그러나 우리나라의 현실에 출퇴근재해를 산업재해에 포함시켜 보호하는 것이 과연 타당한 것인가에 대한 의문이 존재한다. 기존의 출퇴근 재해는 사용자가 제공하는 교통수단이나 이에 준하는 교통수단을 이용하여 출퇴근하는 도중에 발생하는 사고에 대해서만 보호를 하였으나 개정된 ‘산재보험법’에서는 통상적인 경로와 방법으로 출퇴근하는 중발생한 사고도 출퇴근재해의 범위에 포함시키고 있어 그 보호의 범위가 기존보다 매우 넓게 인정된다.
따라서 우리나라의 산재보험은 근로자의 과실여부와 상관없이 재해근로자 무과실책임의원칙을 인정하는 재해보상제도이므로 사업주의 산재보험료의 증가로 인한 보험료 납부액 증가 문제가 예상되며, 출퇴근중의 사고는 사업장 밖에서 발생하는 재해이므로 사용자에게 이에대한 책임을 모두 부담하는 것이 타당한 것인지에 관한 문제, 출퇴근 재해의 경우에는 근로자의 고의·자해행위 등에 대하여 이를 입증하기가 어렵고, 조사기구 등에 대한 입법이 마련되지않아 부정수급문제 등 근로자의 도덕적 해이문제 등이 발생할 수 있다. 또한 가장 중요한 문제로서 대부분의 근로자들이 자동차로 출퇴근을 하기 때문에 자동차로 인한 사고가 발생할 가능성이 높음에도 불구하고 자동차보험과 산재보험 간의 보상범위의 차이에서 오는 문제점, 공단의 구상권 행사 시 보험사와의 분쟁의 발생문제, 입법을 통해 해결할 시 보험사의 영업권 침해문제 등 다양한 문제가 발생할 가능성이 있으므로, 현재 마련된 구상금협의조정기구를 통하여이를 해결할 필요성이 있다. 따라서 구상금협의와 관련된 문제는 독일, 일본 등의 해외의 출퇴근재해를 보장하는 나라에서 이미 충분한 논의를 거친 문제이므로 구상금협의조정기구를 운영할 때 그 나라들의 입법례를 비교법적인 분석을 통하여 우리나라의 교통 실정과 기존의 ‘산재보험법’의 원칙과 충돌하지 않는 출퇴근재해 보호시스템을 갖추어야 할 것이다. 독일은 분담협정을 통하여 보험사와 사회보험업자 간의 손해사고를 합리적으로 규율하고 있으므로 구상금협의조정기구 구성에 있어 이를 참고할 필요가 있을 것이다. 일본의 경우는 출퇴근재해에대해 근로자에게 일정부분 부담금을 부과하고 있다. 사용자가 재해예방이 불가능한 출퇴근 재해로 인하여 보험료율이 상승하고 보험료 납부액이 증가하는 것은 불합리하므로 근로자가 출퇴근재해에 한하여 일정부분 보험료를 납부와 중대한 과실에 대해서는 감액처리 하는 것이 형평의 ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the statistical period, we used the number of vehicles which are covered by auto insurance and the number of accidents. To maximize the reduction effect of accidents caused by the driver's carelessness, the analysis was limited to Physical Damage Coverage that covers the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged vehicle caused by the driver's fault. Due to Personal Information Protection Law, it was not capable of comparing the same vehicle using Vehicle Identification Number in this study. Instead of that, we used it as a similar vehicle, so there are limits to the comparison and analysis results. As a result of this study, we have found that the effect of reducing accidents was different depending on the vehicle class, but it was generally concluded that the number of accidents decreased when the vehicle was equipped with an AEB system. Domestic research on the AEB effect of reducing accidents is not active yet. Therefore, it is absolutely essential to analyze the effects according to various conditions such as driver's age, occupation and gender as well as expanding the study models in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle(PHEV) system, which attracts the attention of consumers in recent years, combines the advantages of an electric vehicle(EV) and a hybrid electric vehicle(HEV). The PHEV system uses a large capacity battery that is charged through a household power source in order to extend the mileage. The PHEV system that can travel long distances with electricity only requires high efficiency electric drive. After the battery is exhausted, the engine must be able to sustain the charge of the battery while driving. Therefore, the loss of power from the engine to the wheels must be small. In this paper, a newly designed system is introduced for the characteristics of PHEV. The system is similar to the parallel TMED type. However, the difference is that a dual clutch is used, a multi-speed transmission is not used, and a motor is attached to each stage. The gear ratio of the system and the capacity of the power source were designed to evaluate the fuel efficiency. The system showed an improved fuel economy of 44.58 %, as compared to the internal combustion engine vehicle(ICEV) in the CS mode that sustained the charge of the battery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, changing or manipulating ECU software can affect the vehicle""s functions, operation and data. ECU tuning also meets the needs of car users who want to drive their cars in a better environment.
  ECUs are parts of automobiles, but legal discussions are necessary across various legal fields because they are computer systems. The normal operation of the ECU is important for safety, security, personal information, privacy, and intellectual property rights. So this paper looks at what ECU and ECU tuning mean to do a legal policy review of ECU tuning, discusses some of the considerations related to allowing ECU tuning, and then looks at some of the laws surrounding ECU tuning to discuss legal issues.
  ECU tuning is related to various laws regarding the software of the ECU, and ECU tuning may be restricted or allowed by these laws. ECU tuning has the social problems that arise from it, but the interest of automobile users is also very important. It is true that ECU tuning is a situation in which socially problematic situations are being documented, but It doesn""t seem to be the situation that it can be completely forbidden in that it is performed in various ways to improve the performance of automobiles or to improve the convenience of users, including tune-up tuning of automobiles.
  Therefore, an appropriate level of regulation may be required for ECU tuning, and it is necessary to limit certain actions at the appropriate level while avoiding unnecessary regulation. And technical and policy measures related to the security of the ECU system must be prepared. In addition, in terms of intellectual property, it is necessary to appropriately operate restrictions or exceptions on copyrights in policy to promote the development of ECU-related technologies, but not to excessively limit the interests of users for software having characteristics of copyrighted works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existing solution to this problem is to solve the problem by adding a noise reduction device or increasing the coupling torque. In this paper, we propose an electric-engine fluctuation canceling (EFC) algorithm that can solve the NVH problem by canceling the engine torque fluctuation to the drive line. HSG speed was used to generate EFC motor torque, and Band Pass Filter and RLS Adaptive Filter technology were used. The EFC torque is added to the feed-forward term to the existing motor torque command to eliminate engine torque fluctuations.

Here, we suggest our smart vehicle seat system capable of real-time driver posture monitoring by using the air bag sensor package with high sensitivity and reliability. The ergonomic numerical model which can evaluate a driver's posture has been developed on the basis of the human body segmentation method followed by simulation-based validation. Our experimental analysis of obtained pressure distribution of a vehicle seat under the different driver's postures revealed our smart vehicle system successfully achieved the driver's real-time posture data in great agreement with our numerical model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virginia 판례에서 영장주의의 예외인 자동차수색의 법리(motor vehicle exception)와 관련하여 개인 주거의 위요지(curtilage) 내에서 오토바이를 영장 없이 수색한 것이 적법한 것인가가 문제되었다. 미연방대법원은 위요지도 개인의 주거의 일부이며 엄격히 보호해야 한다고 보아 이 사례에 자동차수색의 예외는 적용될 수 없다고 판단했다. 우리 헌법재판소도 2018년 결정에서, 체포영장이 발부된 피의자의 발견을 위하여 주거 등을 수색하는 경우, 수색영장을 발부받기 어려운 긴급한 사정이 인정되지 않는 경우에도 영장 없이 주거 수색을 허용하는 형사소송법 규정은 영장주의를 위반한 것이라 판단했다.
개인의 주거의 자유는 헌법상 보장된 기본권의 하나이며, 우리 헌법이 ‘주거의 자유’에 관하여 특히 영장주의를 선언하고 있는 것은 그만큼 개인의 주거의 자유의 중요성을 말하는 것이라 하겠다. 영장주의에 관해서는 긴급성 등 다양한 근거로 예외가 인정되고 있으나, 그러한 예외는 특히 개인의 주거의 자유와 관련해서는 엄격히 해석할 필요가 있다. 2018년의 미연방대법원의 Collins 판결과 우리 헌법재판소 결정 모두 위법한 강제처분으로부터 개인의 주거의 자유를 보호하려는 헌법정신을 충실한 반영한 것으로서 영장주의의 의미와 영장주의 예외의 범위 해석과 관련하여 많은 시사를 주는 것으로 판단된다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  연구방법: 자동차의 외형을 평가할 때 디자이너가 공통적으로 사용하는 형용사 쌍으로 이모티콘이 없을 때 대비 있을 때 느낌을 평가하게 했다. 총 61명의 디자이너 혹은 디자인 관련자가 두 개 모두 평가하였고, 이모티콘의 애니메이션을 확인할 수 있는 온라인 설문으로 수행했다.
  연구결과: 16쌍의 형용사를 의미차별화 다항목 척도로 피실험자 내 디자인으로 두 디자인에 대해 평가하게 하였다. 3개 척도로 각각의 항목에 대해 평가한 점수를 비교한 결과, 총 8쌍의 형용사가 이모티콘 적용 전후 다르게 인식된 것으로 나타났다. 이것을 해석하기 위해 요인분석을 실시하여 유의한 그룹핑을 형성하였다. 총 5개 요소로 그룹핑되고 이 중 4개 요소에 영향이 있었다. 이모티콘 적용 후 더 신나는, 우아한, 동적인, 부드러운, 현대적인, 미래적인, 여성스러운, 가벼운 쪽으로 나타났다.
  결론: 인공지능과 같은 우리 삶에 편익을 주는 기술을 탑재한 자율주행차가 일반 차량과 다른 존재라는 점을 긍정적으로 다가간 결과는 긍정적이다. 기술에 대한 신뢰를 회복하는 데 기여하기 위해서는 이모티콘의 스타일 및 상황에 따른 인터랙션에 대해 더 고민할 필요가 있겠다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

정책적인 측면에서 볼 때 자율주행 분야에서는 스마트 환경-통신과 자율주행 플랫폼-계산에서 기술적 성과가 클 것으로 기대되었다. PCT 특허를 분석하면 당초의 기대와 유사한 결과가 나왔지만, 미국특허 분석에서는 통신 기술에서의 특허만 부각되었다. 또한 특허의 양적 성장은 대학이 주도했지만, 경쟁력 있는 기술은 민영기업의 몫이었다. 결론적으로 차세대 자동차 기술이라는 큰 틀에서 는 중국의 산업정책 방향과 기술혁신의 결과가 일치하는 것으로 보였지만, 구 체적으로 들여다보면 진정한 혁신은 민간 영역에서 발생하였다. 이는 정부의 영향력이 기대보다 크지 않았음을 시사한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the recently realized autonomous drive system consumes about 2.5kW of power, which is an enormous amount of electrical energy. Accordingly, there is a concern that the fuel consumption will be increased when the autonomous drive system is introduced. In order to solve these problems, we propose a Power management strategy for 48V MHEV with the high electric power loads. First, a quasi-static vehicle model that includes the electrical system of the 48V mild hybrid vehicle (12V battery, 48V battery, DC/DC converter, and electric accessory) is developed. Then, Dynamic Programming which is widely used as a global optimal control strategy is performed. Through this, the optimal control inputs Power Slip Ratio and output power of DC/DC Converter are obtained. Lastly, based on the results of the DP, we design a rule-based controller that can be applied in real time. As a result, we can improve the fuel efficiency by optimizing the power distribution control even in the case of high electric power load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, these motors have been widely employed in the electric fuel pumps because of its high-efficiency, high-reliability, compact size, light weight, and simple control method. However, despite the various advantages, brushless DC motors have realistic problems. These problems are acoustic noise and vibration, which are caused by torque ripple and sudden current fluctuation in the stator windings due to the mechanical structures and control methods. If the mechanical structures are redesigned or the control methods are improved, both cogging torque and torque ripple due to commutation can be reduced. Nevertheless, if quasi-square-wave currents are supplied to these motors by conventional methods, the stator windings may generate the electromagnetic noise and vibration within the audio frequency bands. In this paper, a sinusoidal-wave driving method is proposed to suppress the fluctuating currents. The reduction effects on noise and vibration are verified through computer simulations and experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, a new method in determining and isolating faulty sensors in a vehicle’s control system was investigated. The proposed method calculated the constraints and the residuals by applying the model-based fault diagnosis method to the sensors of the chassis system. To solve the inaccuracies of fault isolation in residuals, the sensitivity analysis was applied to the residual incident matrix to derive a fault isolation table, and to establish a fault isolation strategy.

The 4S means four domains business of Chinese auto shop, i.e., Sales of vehicle, Spare parts supply, Service (mainly after care service), Survey for business feedback.
With the slowing growth rate of Chinese economy, the auto sales volume also decreases continuously. Moreover, completion for auto sales are intensifying between Chinese indigenous companies and global companies in Chinese automobile market. At this atmosphere, Chinese auto 4s shops should preserve the profit shrinking from the decline in sales of cars through other business. Chinese auto 4s shops relocate their main business from auto sailing to after care services (A/S).
By the way, auto A/S has the property that highly professional knowledge is required, customers are less likely to feel the level of service quality without difficulties. Therefore, the SNS and other social information are usually going to be taken into consideration by customers to predict, estimate or feel the level of service quality.
This paper examines the mediator of SNS information which is able to provide significant functions for Chinese customers such as customer information diffusion, experience sharing, and quality evaluation on Chinese auto 4S shops's services.
The proxies for service quality of auto 4S shops based on the five dimensions, e.g., tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy in this paper. This paper executes path analyses based on 234 questionnaires by employing a structural equation model. The empirical results show as follows: first, A/S quality has a positive influence on customer satisfaction and loyalty; second, SNS has a positive influence on customer satisfaction; third, SNS has a mediating effect on the relationship between A/S quality and consumer satisfaction.
The empirical results suggest that improving 4S shop’s service quality can be a way to get higher market share through enhancing customer’s satisfaction. In addition, Chinese 4S shops should exploit SNS instrument more actively as a tool of relationship-marketing for customer satisfaction. Furthermore, authors argue that vigorous SNS marketing activities can be regarded as a means of the competitive advantage of automobile distribution companies in Chinese auto industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the traction motor requires a high fill factor. When the rectangular wire is applied to the motor, the fill factor can be increased, so that it has a high power density. However, in the high-speed region, the AC resistance increases due to the effect of the eddy currents in the conductor, and thus the loss increases. Therefore, when designing a motor using a rectangular wire, the effect of AC resistance should be considered. In this paper, AC resistance according to several shapes and arrangements of rectangular wire is compared. The AC resistance is calculated through the 2-dimensional finite element analysis (2-D FEA) at the max-speed operation point, and the current density distribution of rectangular wire is compared.

As a result of the analysis, it can be concluded that the automobile agreement has a certain positive effect on the elimination of the asymmetries of the automobile industry between the two countries. Despite initial concerns about the launch of MERCOSUR, about 30 years later, the asymmetries of the automobile industry between the two countries have not deteriorated but rather improved. However, the convergence width was not large. In particular, since Brazil’s trade surplus with Argentina has been expanding since 2015, it is highly likely to develop into a possibility for future trade disputes. As a result, the concern about asymmetries might yet become a stumbling block to the full liberalization of automotive trade. It is very difficult to solve the asymmetries in the automobile industry between the two countries only through the automotive agreement. In order to improve this, complementary policy measures such as production integration policies should be concurrently carried out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, as the need for electric vehicles and eco-friendly vehicles has been emerging, the reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are becoming the most important issues for automobile manufacturers. In the case of wheel bearings, seals are a key part of drag torque. In this study, we investigate the prediction of the drag torque taking into consideration the hyperelastic and viscoelastic material properties of automotive wheel bearing seals.
Numerical analysis based on the finite element method is conducted for the deformation analyses of the seals. To improve the reliability of the rubber seal analysis, three types of rubber material properties are considered, and analysis is conducted using the hyperelastic material properties. Viscoelastic material property tests are also conducted. Deformation analysis considering the hyperelastic and viscoelastic material properties is performed, and the effects of the viscoelastic material properties are compared with the results obtained by the consideration of the hyperelastic material properties. As a result of these analyses, the drag torque is 0.29 Nm when the hyperelastic characteristics are taken into account, and the drag torque is 0.27 Nm when both the hyperelastic and viscoelastic characteristics are taken into account. Therefore, it is determined that the analysis considering both hyperelastic and viscoelastic characteristics must be performed because of its reliability in predicting the drag torque of the rubber seals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aluminum was used as the base material to reduce weight and steel was used as the HUB bearing house in the central region of the knuckle to enhance structural safety. Thermal stresses caused by the HUB bearing were simulated together with stresses caused by the external forces developing at the joints of lower control arm and upper control arm when the vehicle experiences a 30 degree step steering at 60Km/h. Our analyses also include experiences of structural failure of the HUB bearing and spindle shaft during the driving practice of the vehicle, and hence a modified design was suggested to guarantee enough safety. Structural analyses of the new knuckles were found to give appropriate safety factors under the maximum temperature condition of the HUB bearing and severe cornering condition of the vehicle such as the slalom test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the number of domestic cars is about 30 million, and the number of hybrid vehicles is estimated at 240,000, or 1.1 percent of the total. Vehicle fires are often caused by flammable and combustible materials, such as oil and seats. Thus, precise fire detection is difficult because evidence may be easily damaged. Furthermore, there are few cases of fire detection. To determine the source of the fire and its significant identification, simulator experiments have been conducted to identify the possibility of ignition in the high voltage battery and in the high voltage connecting the electric motor to the high voltage battery, both of which produce and transmit high energies. As a result, it is required to check for leakages of electrolytes in the fuel and in the battery, check for high voltage leakages in the vehicle, including the start control, spark plugs, and other sources of ignition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To suppress high temperature oxidation and decarburization, it is necessary to coat the hot stamping steel. In the present work, the performance of galvannealed coated (GA) hot stamped steel was evaluated. During cyclic corrosion tests, the steel substrate began to corrode after the heat treated galvannealed coating fully corroded, because a Zn alloyed coating provides cathodic protection. In order to be applied to the automotive body-in-white, GA coated hot stamped steel must overcome drawbacks such as liquid metal embrittlement (LME) due to the low melting temperature of the Zn, and low or limited weldability due to the thick surface ZnO layer. The results of this study showed that an increase in the α-Fe(Zn) phase fraction of the coating was an effective way to prevent LME.

이에 본 연구는 폐기가 아닌 재활용의 촉진을 위하여 ① 현행 법령에 위반되지 아니하면서도, ② 기존의 사업자(특히, 렌탈사업자)들이 활용하고 있는 수단을 동원하여, ③ 고비용을 들이지 아니하면서도, ④ 재활용의 전제조건인 수거의무의 이행이 쉽게 될 수 있는 방안을 모색해 본 것이다.
?전기?전자제품 및 자동차의 자원순환에 관한 법률?은 전기?전자제품의 제조업자?수입업자 및 판매자에게 재활용의무를 부과하고 있으나, 렌탈사업자에게는 그러한 의무를 부과하고 있지는 아니하다. 만일 렌탈사업자의 렌탈제품의 관리서비스직원을 통한 회수 내지 역회수를 실시할 수 있는 방안을 강구한다면, 추가적 비용을 거의 들이지 아니하면서도 중?소형기기의 회수율을 획기적으로 높일 수 있는 장점이 있을 것이다.
이를 위해서는 렌탈사업영역만의 별도 관리시스템의 구축이 필요하다.
이에 첫 번째 대안으로 ‘전기?전자제품 렌탈사업자 재활용사업공제조합’을 설립하는 것이다. 이럴 경우에는 타사제품 회수를 금지하고 있는 현행 자원순환법을 준수하면서도 위 공제조합에 가입된 개별 렌탈사업자의 관리서비스직원을 통한 타사제품을 포함한 중소형기기의 회수 및 재활용률을 획기적으로 높일 수 있고, 이를 통한 회수비용의 획기적인 절감의 사회경제적 효과가 나타난다는 장점이 있다.
두 번째 대안으로는 ‘전기?전자제품 중소형기기 재활용사업공제조합’을 설립하는 것이다. 대형기기의 경우에는 컨베이어 벨트방식, 중형?소형기기의 경우에는 일일이 작업자가 해체하는 방식으로 재활용이 되고 있기에 제품별로 구분된 공제조합의 설립이 타당한 듯 보인다. 이럴 경우에는 유가물이 적은 중형?소형기기만의 체계적인 재활용체계를 구축할 수 있고, 중소형기기의 재활용을 위한 권역별 재활용센터(RC)를 구축하면 효율적인 재활용체계가 구축될 것이다.
위의 두 가지 대안의 경우에는 복수의 공제조합이라는 논란이 발생할 소지는 분명히 있다. 이에 차선책으로 자발적 협약을 통하여 렌탈사업 및 중소형기기를 대상으로 하는 재활용의무 이행을 강화하는 방안을 시도하여 보는 것이다. 즉, ‘렌탈제품’과 함께 ‘중형기기’, ‘소형기기’ 및 ‘통신?사무기기’을 대상으로 한 자발적 협약을 통한 재활용의무이행을 실시하는 것이다.
결론적으로 국가적 측면에서 ‘재활용률 높이기’, 기업적 측면에서 ‘비용 절감’의 양자를 모두 해결할 수 있는 대안은 렌탈사업자의 관리서비스직원을 통한 자사 및 타사제품의 회수가능성을 열어둘 필요성이 존재한다.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
